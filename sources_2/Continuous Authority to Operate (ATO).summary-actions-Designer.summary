To show compliance with the standards for a web application from a Human-Centered Design perspective focusing on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), the following practical actions are essential:

1. **Establish Security Protocols for UX/UI:**
   - Ensure that UI elements do not compromise the security of the application. This involves avoiding the display of sensitive information and implementing secure input fields to protect user data.

2. **Incorporate User Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Design the application to include mechanisms like user surveys, feedback forms, or usability testing feedback sessions that capture user input about security and usability. This feedback is crucial for continuous improvement.

3. **Follow Accessibility Guidelines:**
   - Design the interfaces following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Compliance with these standards is also a key part of government requirements for public web applications.

4. **Optimize for Performance and Security:**
   - Ensure that the design facilitates a quick load time and smooth interactions, which are critical for maintaining the security and efficiency of the web application. Use optimized images and proper file formats that do not hinder the performance.

5. **Participate in Security Training:**
   - Engage with security awareness training specifically tailored for designers to understand how design choices can impact the cybersecurity of the application. Apply this knowledge to create safer user interfaces.

6. **Implement and Manage UI Components Securely:**
   - Use standardized UI components that comply with security best practices. This could involve using components that have been vetted for vulnerabilities and are regularly updated.

7. **Secure Software Supply Chain for UI Libraries:**
    - Ensure that any third-party libraries or tools used in the design process are secure and free from vulnerabilities. Regularly update these tools to mitigate any potential security risks.

8. **Collaborative Integration with DevSecOps:**
    - Work closely with the DevSecOps team to ensure that the design integrates seamlessly into the overall development and operation pipelines, supporting continuous integration and delivery with a focus on security.

9. **Documentation:**
    - Properly document design processes, decisions, and modifications related to security and user experience. This documentation should be accessible for review and compliance verification.

10. **User Training and Support Materials:**
    - Design help sections or tutorial overlays that educate users on secure practices while using the application, potentially reducing user error and enhancing overall security.

By focusing on these areas, a designer can significantly contribute to creating a web application that not only provides an excellent user experience but also adheres to the rigorous security standards expected by government contracts.
