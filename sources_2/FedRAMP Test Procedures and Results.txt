Instructions - please read carefully,,,,
Overview,,,,
This test case workbook is to be used to document the test results from a 3PAO assessment.,,,,
The subsections below provide an overview of each of the tabs and instructions on how to complete this workbook.,,,,
,,,,
System Tab,,,,
The System tab is mostly auto-generated. The only information needed is in Rows 1-4.,,,,
Row 1: System Name,,,,This is the formal name of the cloud service offering.
Row 2: System Acronym,,,,This is the formal acronym of the cloud service offering.
Row 3: CSP Name,,,,This is the cloud service provider's name.
Row 4: 3PAO Name,,,,This is the 3PAO's name (organizational level).
Row 5: Categorization Level,,,,"This should be the categorization level (Li-SaaS, Low, Moderate, or High). This will be pre-populated based on the template downloaded."
,,,,
The Assessment Results box will show the total number of controls that pass vs. the total number of controls that failed; this box is auto-calculated.,,,,
Total Controls,,,,This is the total number of controls to be tested.
Satisfied,,,,"This is the total number of controls that were deemed to be properly implemented. Satisfied means that the control has been Implemented, Alternative Implemented, or Inherited."
Other than Satisfied,,,,"This is the total number of controls that were deemed to not be properly implemented and marked as a risk. Other than Satisfied means that the control has been Partially Implemented, 
 Not Implemented, or is Planned."
Not Applicable,,,,This result is used when the implementation status is marked as 'Not Applicable'.
,,,,
The Finding / Risk Level box will show the total number of risks identified by risk level. This box is auto-calculated.,,,,
High,,,,This is the total number of controls that were marked as 'Other than Satisfied' and with an associated risk level of High.
Moderate,,,,This is the total number of controls that were marked as 'Other than Satisfied' and with an associated risk level of Moderate.
Low,,,,This is the total number of controls that were marked as 'Other than Satisfied' and with an associated risk level of Low.
,,,,
The Summary boxes for each control will sum the number of controls that were marked as 'Other than Satisfied' and their associated risk level; these boxes are auto-calculated.,,,,
The Summary boxes for each control will also sum the total number of controls that were marked with an SSP differential. These boxes are auto-calculated.,,,,
,,,,
Control Summary Tab,,,,
"The Control Summary tab is completely auto-generated. It lists all controls in the baseline. If a control is removed from the respective family tab (e.g., AT, CA, CM, etc.), then the respective control row must be removed from this tab.",,,,
Column D: Assessment Results,,,,"This is the summary roll-up of the assessment result for the control after taking into account each of the test procedure test results. This column is auto-calculated. If one test procedure fails, then 
 the control is marked 'Other than Satisfied'."
Column E: Risk Exposure Level,,,,This is the summary roll-up of the risk exposure level for the control after taking into account each of the test procedure test results. This column is auto-calculated to pull the highest watermarked value.
Column F: SSP Differential Count,,,,"This is the summary count of the number of SSP differentials identified from each of the test procedure test results. This column is auto-calculated. This is just a mere count, not the details associated
  to why the differential exists."
,,,,
"Family Tabs (e.g., AC, AU, AT, etc.)",,,,
The 18 family tabs is where all the work is to be documented.,,,,
Column A: Control Name,,,,This is the control name from NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5.
Column B: Control ID,,,,This is the control identifier from NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5.
Column C: Assessment Procedure ID,,,,This is the test case procedure ID from NIST SP 800-53A Revision 5.
Column D: Assessment Objective,,,,This is the test case procedure details from NIST SP 800-53A Revision 5.
Column E: Assessment Parameter,,,,This is the FedRAMP parameter as documented in the FedRAMP SSP template.
Column F: Additional FedRAMP Requirements / Guidance,,,,This is the additional FedRAMP requirements and/or guidance as documented in the FedRAMP SSP template.
Column G: Test Method,,,,"This is the test method(s) that must be used to perform the assessment procedure from NIST SP 800-53A Revision 5. Test methods include: Examine, Interview and/or Test."
Column H: Observations / Test Results,,,,"This is the field to be used to document what was tested, how it was tested and the end result of the test."
Column I: Evidence,,,,This is the field to be used to document the evidence that was collected during the test.
Column J: Assessment Result,,,,A dropdown is available here to document the assessment result. Assessment results include: Satisfied or Other than Satisfied.
Column K: Identified Risk,,,,This is the field to be used to document any associated risks identified. This should just be the risk/failure.
Column L: Likelihood Level,,,,"A dropdown is available here to document the likelihood level that the risk could be exploited. Levels include: High, Moderate, or Low."
Column M: Impact Level,,,,"A dropdown is available here to document the impact level that the risk could be exploited. Levels include: High, Moderate, or Low."
Column N: Risk Exposure Level,,,,This entry will be auto-calculated based on the likelihood and impact levels.
Column O: Recommendation for Mitigation,,,,This is the field to be used to document the proposed recommendation to remediate the risk and align to the control requirement.
Column P: SSP Implementation Differential?,,,,"This is the field to be used to document any controls that are documented incorrectly in the SSP vs. what is actually in place. If there is no differential, the cell must be left blank. If there is a differential, then the assessor must document in this cell what the differential is in detail so the cloud service provider knows what needs to be fixed. All differentials should be aggregated into a PL-2 risk for remediation."
