### Document Summary: HTTPS-Only Standard for Federal Websites and Services

#### Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

1. **HTTPS Mandate**:
   - All publicly accessible Federal websites and web services must serve content over HTTPS to ensure secure and private connections. 

2. **Compliance Deadline**:
   - All existing websites and services must transition to HTTPS-only by December 31, 2016.

3. **Security Protocols**:
   - Enforce the use of HTTPS, which encrypts data exchanged and verifies the website or service's identity.
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to make browsers default to secure connections.
   - Include Server Name Indication (SNI) for efficient handling of multiple domains on a single IP address.

4. **Certificates**:
   - Use certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities to affirm the legitimacy of the web service.

5. **Mixed Content Handling**:
   - Ensure that all external resources loaded on a website (like images, scripts, fonts) are served over HTTPS to prevent security vulnerabilities.

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Adopt newer protocols like SPDY or HTTP/2 that improve site performance and security but require HTTPS.

7. **Accessibility Guidelines**:
   - Although HTTPS is encouraged on intranets, it is not explicitly required.

8. **Monitoring and Updates**:
   - Continuous monitoring through tools like the public dashboard on pulse.cio.gov.
   - Stay updated with latest security practices and standards via resources like https.cio.gov.
