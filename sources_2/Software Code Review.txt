ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT
This document has been developed to provide guidance on vulnerability scanning policy, procedures, and
tools in support of achieving and maintaining a security authorization that meets the Federal Risk and
Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) requirements.
Some cloud service providers (CSPs) may need to transition from their current vulnerability scanners or work
with their vendors in order to meet the requirements.
This document is not a FedRAMP template – there is nothing to fill out in this document.
This document uses the term authorizing official (AO). For systems with a Joint Authorization Board (JAB)
provisional authorization to operate (P-ATO), AO refers primarily to the JAB unless this document explicitly
says agency AO. For systems with a FedRAMP Agency Authorization to Operate (ATO), AO refers to each
leveraging agency’s AO.
WHO SHOULD USE THIS DOCUMENT?
This document is intended to be used by CSPs, third party assessment organizations (3PAOs), government
contractors working on FedRAMP projects, and government employees working on FedRAMP projects.

FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements
1.0 Purpose
Continuous monitoring (ConMon) ensures CSPs continuously maintain the security of their FedRAMP
Authorized systems by providing the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and authorizing officials (AOs) monthly
insight into the security posture of the system. CSP scanning policies, procedures, and tools (including
vulnerability scanners) are key components to ConMon activities. In an effort to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of ConMon activities, the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) provides guidance for
scanning requirements. This document summarizes those requirements.
2.0 Background
The vulnerability scanning requirements are part of the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide and
the appropriate FedRAMP Low, Moderate, or High security control baselines, specifically in control RA-5.
The ConMon scanning requirements move FedRAMP ConMon activities toward efficiencies, advance the
quality of ConMon information provided to FedRAMP, and better position FedRAMP to perform robust
analysis in the near future. These changes also better enable FedRAMP to scale up as the volume of
FedRAMP Authorized systems continues to increase.
Further, FedRAMP has an obligation to determine and enforce CSP compliance with such
security requirements.
3.0 Scanning Requirements
Scanning requirements are also outlined in the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide and the
FedRAMP Low, Moderate, and High security control baselines.
This document expands on the original requirements:
●
Scanner Resiliency: Scanners should be hardened to resist unauthorized use or modification (i.e.,
unnecessary ports and/or unnecessary services should be closed).
●
Authenticated Scanning: For Moderate and High systems, the CSP must ensure authenticated
scans are performed wherever possible. [RA-5(5)]
●
Scanning with Full Authorization: For all Moderate and High systems, the CSP must ensure that
scans are being performed with full system authorization. [RA-5(5)]
fedramp.gov

FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements
○
Scanning must avoid typical lack of authorization issues (including lack of access to remote
registry, limited registry access, limited file access, etc.).
●
Machine-Readable Findings: The scan output must display all scan findings with a low risk or
higher in a structured, machine-readable format (such as XML, CSV, or JSON).
○
If the scanner is able to output/export findings in more than one machine-readable format,
the CSP must select the format that provides the greatest amount of information.
○
Where possible, the machine-readable data must include the authentication and
authorization status of the scans to demonstrate the degree to which an authenticated scan
was performed on each host.
●
National Vulnerability Database (NVD): For any vulnerability listed in the latest version of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) NVD, the Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) reference number must be included with the machine-readable findings data for
that vulnerability.
●
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Risk Scoring: For any vulnerability with a CVSSv3
base score assigned in the latest version of the NVD, the CVSSv3 base score must be used as the
original risk rating. If no CVSSv3 score is available, a CVSSv2 base score is acceptable where
available. If no CVSS score is available, the native scanner base risk score can be used.
●
Configuration Settings: The CSP must provide machine-readable evidence that the scanner’s
configuration settings have not been altered from the 3PAO-validated configuration settings
approved during the initial authorization assessment.
●
Configuration Changes: If a scanner configuration change is required (above and beyond normal
patching and updates) the AO must be notified and approve of the change.
●
Signature Updates: For each deliverable, the CSP must update the list of vulnerabilities scanned to
the latest available list. [RA-5(2)]
○
The CSP must use a vulnerability scanner that checks for automatic signature updates of
the scanner’s vulnerability database at least monthly.
○
The CSP must provide automated machine-readable evidence of the most recent update
performed prior to scanning.
●
Adequate Asset Identification: The scanner findings must contain unique asset identifiers that map
to an inventory.
○
The CSP must have an automated mechanism to identify and catalog all assets, within the
authorization boundary, every month in order to ensure that everything is being scanned
appropriately
○
For Web scans, a dynamically updated catalog of Web services should be maintained to
include the ports where Web services reside.
●
Types of Scans: CSPs must scan operating systems, Web applications, and databases monthly. All
scan reports must be sent to the AO/JAB monthly. [RA-5]
○
The entire inventory (or approved sampling percentage) within the boundary must be
scanned at the operating system (OS) level at least once a month.

FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements
○
All Web interfaces and services (or approved sampling percentage) must be scanned.
○
All databases (or approved sampling percentage) must be scanned, including those
required to support the infrastructure.
●
Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) Entries: The CSP must track each unique vulnerability as
an individual POA&M item.
○
Individual vulnerabilities must be based on the scanning tool’s unique vulnerability reference
identifier (ID).
○
The CSP may break a unique vulnerability into multiple POA&M items, such as for a
vulnerability that applies to different asset types that will be remediated in different ways.
○
The CSP must not group multiple unique vulnerabilities into a single POA&M item.
●
All Non-Destructive Detections: The CSP must enable all non-destructive detections within
the scanner.
●
Image Scanning: Where the CSP offers services, such as virtual images, and where the customer is
responsible for scanning but is reliant on the CSP for patching, the CSP must scan the source image
for all available customer leveraged images.
○
This applies to all images in use or available for use by federal government customers.
4.0 Scanning Requirements for Systems
Using Container Technology
The below vulnerability scanning requirements are specific to and for use with containerized systems. This
guidance serves to supplement the requirements defined elsewhere in this document as well as guidance
found within the FedRAMP Low, Moderate, and High Security Control Baselines and FedRAMP Continuous
Monitoring Strategy Guide.
Container technology can be deployed on bare metal or virtual machines, on-premise systems, or within
elastic cloud environments. Various container orchestration tools are typically used to enable deployment
and management of distributed containers at scale. Some of most common characteristics of container
technology are :
1
●
Containers run application(s) and their dependencies that should be isolated from other processes.
●
Containers have network connections that are host independent.
●
Containers are elastic and sometimes ephemeral in nature.
1 The characteristics, risks, and terms contained in this document are derived from the NIST SP 800-190, Application Container
Security Guide (published September 2017), and industry input.
fedramp.gov

FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements
●
Containers are immutable, upgrades occur on a source image in a secure staging environment
and upgrading a container involves destroying an existing container and replacing it with a
new container.
Important risks and threats relative to the use of containerization technology include:
●
Unvalidated external software
●
Non-standard configurations
●
Unmonitored container-to-container communication
●
Ephemeral instances that are not tracked
●
Unauthorized access
●
Registry/repository poisoning
●
Unmanaged registry/repository
The security requirements listed within this document facilitate a CSP’s ability to leverage container
technology while maintaining compliance with FedRAMP. The intent of the following security requirements
are to ensure that risks relative to the use of container technology are mitigated or otherwise addressed
(including but not limited to those listed in bullet-point form above). The requirements apply broadly and
FedRAMP recognizes that certain implementations may call for alternative measures to address risk.
●
Hardened Images: The CSP must only utilize containers where the image is “hardened.” Where
applicable, the hardening must be in accordance with relevant benchmarks listed in the National
Checklist Program and defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP
800-70. Benchmarks are used as a baseline and may be altered. However, the final configurations
must be validated by a 3PAO to ensure they meet FedRAMP requirements for the baseline controls:
CM-6, SC-2, SC-3, SC-4, SC-6, SC-28, and SC-39. In the case of containers leveraging an image
that does not have a listed benchmark available, the CSP must create and maintain a 3PAO
validated benchmark for the purpose of hardening. Non-hardened or general-purpose images may
not be used within the authorization boundary. The 3PAO must validate the CSP process of
hardening images intended for deployment. 3PAO validation of every individual container instance
deployed to production is not required. This requirement does not restrict a CSP from leveraging
third-party software within hardened containers. This requirement also does not restrict a CSP from
using hardened images or software obtained from a secure repository in groups which share IP
addresses and may share volumes. Any hardened image put into production should not contain
vulnerabilities previously identified by CISA in the Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalog.
●
Container Build, Test, and Orchestration Pipeline: The CSP must leverage automated container
orchestration tools to build, test, and deploy containers to production. These automated tools must
be validated by a 3PAO to meet FedRAMP requirements for the baseline controls: CA-2, CM-2,
CM-3, SC-28, SI-3, and SI-7. However, components of the pipeline that fall to the left of the
production container registry, including environments intended for development or testing, may
reside outside of the system boundary. Non-automated processes should not be considered part of
the container testing and orchestration process, except in the case of intentional manual procedures
for quality review purposes. These processes and tools must include a mechanism to restrict
containers that do not adhere to FedRAMP requirements from successfully deploying.
fedramp.gov

FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements
●
Vulnerability Scanning for Container Images: Prior to deploying containers to production, a CSP
must ensure that all components of the container image are scanned as outlined in the FedRAMP
Vulnerability Scanning Requirements document. This should be accomplished in the development
environment by a scanner that meets this document's guidelines for this process and those scans
provided to the AO or JAB as part of the monthly ConMon submission. When possible, the container
orchestration process should incorporate scanning as one of the steps in the deployment pipeline.
The 30-day scanning window begins as soon as the container is deployed to the production
registry. Only containers from images that have been scanned within a 30-day vulnerability
scanning window can be actively deployed on the production environment. Additionally,
modification of configuration settings defined within the image or software patching should never
occur directly on the production environment, but rather on the replacement image to be deployed to
production. Performing vulnerability scanning directly on containers deployed to production is not
recommended, unless it is performed via the use of independent security sensors deployed
alongside production-deployed containers.
●
Security Sensors: Independent security sensors may be deployed alongside production-deployed
containers to continuously inventory and assess a CSP’s security posture. This independent
deployment allows the security sensors to maintain broad visibility across containers. Security
sensors should be run with sufficient privileges to avoid lack of visibility and false negatives. If
utilized, security sensors should be deployed everywhere containers execute to include within
registries, as general-purpose sensors, and within CI/CD pipelines. If this approach is taken, the
sampling guidance found in the Guide for Determining Eligibility and Requirements for the Use of
Sampling for Vulnerability Scans document may be applicable.
●
Registry Monitoring: The container registry must be monitored per unique image to ensure that
containers corresponding to an image that has not been scanned within the 30-day vulnerability
scanning window are not actively deployed on production. As the registry itself is often not a policy
control point, this process may be managed by alarms that inform operators or other control
mechanisms to prevent unauthorized deployment.
●
Asset Management and Inventory Reporting for Deployed Containers: A unique asset identifier
must be assigned to every class of image which corresponds to one or more production-deployed
containers. These image-based asset identifiers must be documented in the FedRAMP Integrated
Inventory Workbook Template. Instances of production-deployed containers must be tracked
internally by the CSP via an automated mechanism, which must be validated by a 3PAO to meet the
baseline control CM-8. Every production-deployed container must correspond to the image from
which the deployed container originated, in order to identify the total number of relevant
vulnerabilities on production associated with that container. While individually deployed instances of
containers should be tracked internally by the CSP, they do not need to be included as part of the
FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook Template, unless they are specifically the target of a scan
performed by a security sensor. If they are the target of a scan performed by a security sensor, they
must be included as part of the FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook Template ConMon
deliverable, in accordance with the Guide for Determining Eligibility and Requirements for the Use of
Sampling for Vulnerability Scans document, if applicable.
●
Encryption: FedRAMP considers any data in transit, whether that be from one container to another
container, from a container to a sidecar inside the same host virtual machine, or from a container to
fedramp.gov
page 5
FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements
any other source outside that container, that SC-8 controls must be applied to this data in transit.
SC-8 protection (usually encryption) is required when data is in transit from one memory processing
space to another.
These requirements ensure AOs are able to provide high-quality ConMon oversight across a CSP’s system
and ensure consistency in scan results for AOs to analyze across multiple systems.
Only scanning tools that meet the revised requirements will be accepted by FedRAMP for ConMon. This may
impact the current ConMon strategy of some CSPs. The FedRAMP PMO can assist CSPs to determine if other
scanners are able to meet FedRAMP requirements.
Note: CSPs and 3PAOs must ensure that all scan results obtained for a specific assessment/point in
time (remediation scan) MUST be in the same format (by scan type and scanner type) (e.g., all fields
covered in the original scans must be accounted for in the remediation scans). If the scan results do
not align, this can/will prolong the FedRAMP authorization due to the need for the 3PAO or CSP to
reconcile scan results.
