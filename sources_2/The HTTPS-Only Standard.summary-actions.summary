To ensure compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard for a web application, here are the essential actions you need to take:

1. **Implement HTTPS:**
   - **Procure and Install SSL/TLS Certificates:** Obtain certificates from a reliable Certificate Authority (CA). These certificates must be installed on your server to enable HTTPS.
   - **Configure Your Web Server for HTTPS:** Adjust the server settings to ensure all connections are securely handled using HTTPS. This includes configuring cipher suites and TLS versions according to best practices.

2. **Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
   - Configure your web application to send an HTTP header with the HSTS policy, instructing browsers to interact with your website using only HTTPS connections.
   - Optionally, submit your domain to the HSTS preload list for browsers to automatically enforce HTTPS connections.

3. **Ensure All External Resources Are Loaded Over HTTPS (Mixed Content Handling):**
   - Check that all external resources such as images, fonts, scripts, and stylesheets are loaded over HTTPS. This prevents mixed content issues that can compromise the security of your web application.

4. **Automate Redirects from HTTP to HTTPS:**
   - Implement server-side redirects that automatically forward users from HTTP URLs to their HTTPS counterparts. This is to ensure that even if a user enters an HTTP URL, they are securely redirected to HTTPS.

5. **Monitor and Update Security Settings Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and update your encryption settings, SSL/TLS certificates, and compliance with emerging web security standards.
   - Keep abreast of updates from authoritative sources like https.cio.gov for the latest security practices and vulnerabilities.

6. **Verify Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Implementation (If Applicable):**
   - Although not required by the HTTPS-Only Standard, implementing DNSSEC can provide additional security benefits by ensuring the validity of the responses to DNS queries, thus preventing certain types of cyber attacks.

7. **Periodically Test and Validate HTTPS Deployment:**
   - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to verify that HTTPS is properly implemented and functioning as expected.
   - Utilize tools such as SSL Labs' SSL Test to evaluate your serverâ€™s SSL/TLS configuration and performance.

By systematically addressing these areas, you will be able to demonstrate compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard mandated for federally operated or contracted websites and services. This not only enhances the security of the web application but also builds trust with users interacting with government platforms.
