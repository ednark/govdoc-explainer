As a DevOps technician, here is a direct and simplified summary of the primary standards, guidelines, and requirements from the provided document that focus specifically on security, compliance, and the infrastructure management aspects relevant to your role:

### DevSecOps Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO)

#### General Guidelines:
- The Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) is designed to replace traditional point-in-time security assessments with continuous risk management.
- The cATO requires adoption of DevSecOps practices to enhance agility and security through continual deployment capacities.
  
#### Security-Oriented Requirements:
1. **Continuous Monitoring (CONMON):**
   - Development should incorporate system monitoring strategies that continuously check for potential vulnerabilities and threats.
   - Components must include automated monitoring, real-time risk tracking, auditing, incident response plans, compliance reports, and an alert system.
   - Security controls assessments should occur in near real-time using automated processes wherever feasible.

2. **Active Cyber Defense (ACD):**
   - This involves detecting, analyzing, and mitigating threats using CSSP (Certified Cybersecurity Service Provider) tools.
   - Penetration testing, Red/Blue team assessments, and other dynamic tests must be conducted annually at minimum.
   - Cybersecurity adjustments should align with evolving system or environmental factors.

3. **Secure Software Supply Chain (SSSC) and DevSecOps:**
   - Enforce a controlled deployment pipeline through automated security measures including the use of approved DevSecOps platforms adhering to DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Designs.
   - A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) must be maintained and continually analyzed against vulnerabilities in common databases (like CVEÂ®).
   - Leverage tools such as Software Composition Analysis, SAST, DAST, and CWPP for continuous assurance of software components.
   - The infrastructure should employ Cloud Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) for runtime protection and incident response.

#### Compliance and Continuous Integration:
- The process should involve the Configuration as Code (CaC) approach to ensure consistency across environments.
- Techniques for incident responses, including drills and role-specific training, must be documented and regularly updated to align with DevSecOpcodes best practices.
- All systems subject to cATO must initially pass through traditional ATO (Authorization to Operate) processes and be free of high-severity vulnerabilities.

#### Documentation and Approval:
- Maintain an updated system authorization package including security plans, assessment reports, and mitigation strategies.
- cATO status requires approval from senior cybersecurity officers following a stringent review of the continuous monitoring and defense measures in place.

This streamlined focus will guide your technical efforts in designing and managing compliant infrastructure that adheres to both current security mandates and the overarching protocol for continuous authorization and risk management in software deployment environments.
