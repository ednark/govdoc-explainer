To ensure compliance with the FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance from a Developer's perspective, focusing on backend business logic implementation in a Drupal-based web application, the following minimal actions should be taken:

1. **Follow Secure Coding Practices**:
   - Implement proper input validation.
   - Use prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection.
   - Sanitize HTML output to thwart XSS attacks.

2. **Implement Role-Based Access Controls**:
   - Define and enforce granular permissions.
   - Ensure that sensitive actions require appropriate roles.

3. **Configure Insecure HTTP Settings**:
   - Enforce HTTPS connections.
   - Set secure and HTTPOnly flags on cookies.

4. **Conduct Regular Code Reviews**:
   - Participate in peer reviews for all new code.
   - Use automated static code analysis tools.

5. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Log critical actions and security-related events.
   - Ensure logs are stored securely and are tamper-evident.

6. **Validate Configuration Settings**:
   - Use Drupal security modules (e.g., Security Review, Password Policy).
   - Regularly review and update the configurations.

7. **Implement Authentication Mechanisms**:
   - Use strong password policies.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) if applicable.

8. **Secure API Endpoints**:
   - Authenticate and authorize API requests properly.
   - Validate and sanitize API request data.

9. **Integrate Security Tools**:
   - Employ tools like Drupalâ€™s Update Manager for core and module updates.
   - Use security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities.

10. **Coordinate With 3PAO Penetration Testing**:
    - Ensure test accounts and access are ready for 3PAO.
    - Collaborate to resolve any findings promptly.

11. **Document Security Measures**:
    - Keep documentation for all implemented security controls.
    - Ensure all changes and configurations are documented.

By adhering to these actions, a Drupal developer can help ensure that the web application aligns with FedRAMP penetration test standards and maintains a secure environment.
