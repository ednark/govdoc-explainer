Sure, here’s a practical checklist for a project manager to ensure a web application project complies with the FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance standards:

1. **Identify Scope:**
   - Define the system boundary based on the SSP.
   - List all components, services, and internal/external access paths.

2. **Contract a 3PAO:**
   - Ensure the selection of a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO for conducting penetration tests.
   - Obtain agreement from relevant stakeholders.

3. **Establish Rules of Engagement (ROE):**
   - Define and document the procedures, constraints, and methodologies for penetration testing.
   - Include local incident response and evidence handling procedures.

4. **Organize Key Personnel:**
   - Assign and document roles such as System Owner, Trusted Agent, Penetration Test Team Lead, and Team Members.

5. **Testing Schedule:**
   - Develop and approve a detailed schedule for penetration testing activities.
   - Specify start/end dates for different testing phases.

6. **Coordinate Permissions:**
   - Obtain necessary permissions from all third parties involved such as ISPs and MSSPs.

7. **Develop Penetration Test Plan:**
   - Ensure the test plan includes attack vector tactics, scope, and rationale.
   - Address mandatory attack vectors: External to Corporate, External to CSP Target System, Tenant to CSP Management System, Tenant to Tenant, Mobile Application to Target System, Client-side Application and/or Agents to Target System.

8. **Threat Model Implementation:**
   - Use threat models to define the focus of the penetration tests.
   - Ensure the use of current adversarial tactics (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK® framework).

9. **Perform Penetration Tests:**
   - Ensure the penetration tests are executed according to the approved plan.
   - Conduct tasks like phishing attacks, exploitation attempts, and vulnerability assessments.

10. **Reporting and Documentation:**
    - Collect penetration test results and ensure they are documented comprehensively.
    - Sanitize sensitive data and formalize findings, recommendations, and access paths for the final report.

11. **Review and Approval:**
    - Review all findings with stakeholders.
    - Obtain approval on deviations from standard practices (if any) from the Authorizing Official (AO).

12. **Remediation Plan:**
    - Develop and track an action plan for addressing identified vulnerabilities.
    - Monitor continuous improvements and security measure updates.

By following these steps, the project manager can organize and track compliance activities effectively to ensure FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance adherence for the web application.
