Sure, here is a minimal list of actions a DevOps technician would need to take to ensure compliance with FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance standards for a web application:

1. **Implement Secure Configurations:**
   - Configure firewalls, load balancers, and WAFs to enforce security policy.

2. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Ensure proper assignment and management of user roles.

3. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):**
   - Deploy and configure IDPS to identify and mitigate threats.

4. **Data Encryption:**
   - Implement data encryption at rest and in transit using FedRAMP-approved methods.

5. **Zero Trust Architecture:**
   - Design the infrastructure with Zero Trust principles, ensuring strict authentication and authorization.

6. **Network Segmentation:**
   - Segregate networks to ensure separation of production, testing, and development environments.

7. **Apply Security Patches/Updates:**
   - Regularly update systems, libraries, and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

8. **Automated Security Scanning:**
   - Integrate CI/CD pipelines with security scanners to identify vulnerabilities during code deployment.

9. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Require MFA for accessing both management systems and the application itself.

10. **Audit Logging:**
    - Enable and configure comprehensive logging of security events and access.

11. **Penetration Testing Coordination:**
    - Ensure that all necessary permissions and support are in place for required penetration testing activities.

12. **Monitoring and Incident Response:**
    - Implement real-time monitoring and incident response mechanisms for immediate threat mitigation.

13. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
    - Ensure regular backups and a tested disaster recovery plan are in place.

14. **Secure APIs:**
    - Implement API security measures, including rate limiting, validation, and authentication.

15. **Controlled Test Environments:**
    - Use isolated test environments for penetration testing and separate from production.

16. **Documentation and Compliance Reporting:**
    - Maintain documentation of compliance measures and prepare reports as required by FedRAMP.

By systematically addressing these requirements, a DevOps technician can help ensure the project's infrastructure complies with FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance standards.
