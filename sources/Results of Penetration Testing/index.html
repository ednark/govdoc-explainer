About This Document
The purpose of this document is to provide requirements for organizations planning to conduct a FedRAMP
penetration test, as well as the associated attack vectors and overall reporting requirements. A penetration test is a proactive and authorized exercise to break through the security of an IT system. The
main objective of a penetration test is to identify exploitable security weaknesses in an information system. These vulnerabilities may include service and application flaws, insecure configurations, improper
role-based privilege assignments, and risky end-user behavior. A penetration test may also evaluate an
organization’s security policy compliance, its employees’ security awareness, and the organization's ability
to identify and respond to security incidents. Threat actors work diligently to bypass initial system
defenses. Penetration testing ensures that the depth of defense goes beyond initial compromise and/or
takes into account things like proper coding practices being followed. Zero Trust Protection mechanisms should be defined as part of the system boundary and are better
addressed and included in the SSP front matter discussions. This document uses the term authorizing official (AO). For systems with a Joint Authorization Board (JAB)
provisional authorization to operate (P-ATO), AO refers primarily to the JAB unless this document explicitly
says agency AO. For systems with a FedRAMP Agency authorization to operate (ATO), AO refers to each
leveraging agency’s AO. The term authorization refers to either a FedRAMP JAB P-ATO or a FedRAMP Agency ATO. The term third-party assessment organization (3PAO) refers to a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO. The use of a
FedRAMP recognized 3PAO is required for systems with a FedRAMP JAB P-ATO; however, for systems

1.0.</div><div id="chunk-3" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Scope of Testing
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) requires that penetration testing be
conducted in compliance with the following guidance:
●
NIST SP 800-115 (Current Revision)Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and
Assessment
●
NIST SP 800-145 (Current Revision) The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing
●
NIST SP 800-53 (Current Revision) Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and
Organizations
●
NIST SP 800-53A (Current Revision) Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal
Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans
FedRAMP also requires that a CSP’s products and solutions (cloud services) undergoing a FedRAMP
assessment and penetration test must be classified as a SaaS, PaaS, and/or IaaS (see definitions in Table
2). In some scenarios, it may be appropriate to apply multiple cloud service models to a cloud service. Table 2: Cloud Service Classification
Cloud Service
Model
NIST Description (Current Revision)
Software as a
Service (SaaS)
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s applications
running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various
client devices through either a thin-client interface, such as a web browser (e.g.,
web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or
control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating
systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, except for limited
user-specific application configuration settings. Platform as a
Service (PaaS)
The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure
consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages,
libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and
possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment. fedramp.gov
page 1
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
Infrastructure
as a Service
(IaaS)
The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage,
networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer can
deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and
applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed
applications and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g.,
host firewalls). In the final Penetration Test Plan, all components, associated services, and access paths (internal/external)
within the defined test boundary of the CSP’s system must be scoped and assessed.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> A set of attack
vectors will be mandatory, regardless of classification (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, or hybrid) and is outlined in
Section 3.1. CSPs will work, in coordination with their 3PAO, to identify and scope-in other attack vectors
prescribed in this guidance. Any deviations from the mandatory or scoped-in attack vectors must be
approved by an Authorizing Official (AO). The Rules of Engagement (ROE) must identify and define the
appropriate testing method(s) and techniques associated with exploitation of the relevant devices and/or
services. The Penetration Test Plan must address all attack vectors described in Section 3 or explain why a
particular attack vector was deemed out of scope or not applicable. 3PAOs may include additional attack
vectors they believe are appropriate based on the cloud service offering being assessed. See Appendix D:
Rules of Engagement (ROE)/Test Plan Template for more information regarding test plans. 2.0. Threats
CSPs should consult with their 3PAO to derive the most efficient and effective risk profiling for their cloud
service offering (CSO). 2.1.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Threat Models
FedRAMP penetration testing follows multiple threat models developed to align with current adversarial
tactics and techniques. These threat models are built into each attack vector to ensure real-world threats
and risks are analyzed, assessed, mitigated, and accepted by an authorizing authority. 3PAOs should
assess the risk and security of a CSP minimally through the following threat models:
●
Internet based (Untrusted)
○
Network threat actor
○
Attack on CSP managed user
fedramp.gov
page 2
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
○
Email attack against CSP managed user
○
Application threat actor
○
Physical based attack
●
CSP Corporate (Untrusted and Trusted)
○
Breach of CSP management systems
○
Breach of CSP managed support system and/or networks
○
Breach of CSP managed enclave of authorized systems
○
Corporate insider threat
○
Lost CSP managed system
○
Interconnected networks including international entities, foreign adversaries internally
pivoting to US CSO enclave
○
Ransomware spread from CSP Corporate
○
Unauthorized physical access to authorized system
●
Internal Threat (Untrusted and Trusted)
○
Weak permissions and access control
○
Abuse of services of authorized system
○
Ransomware spread from government system
○
Multi organization access to authorized system
○
Unauthorized physical access to authorized system
If a 3PAO determines additional threat models are warranted in order to provide an adequate FedRAMP
assessment, a CSP must be willing to consider what the 3PAO recommends. If a 3PAO and CSP cannot
come to terms, and an AO determines that this additional testing should be performed, this may extend a
CSP’s time to FedRAMP authorization. 2.2. Attack Models
Depending on the authorized service architecture (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, hybrid), all or some attack models
may apply. Additionally, attack models may be tested in different or multiple ways, and testers are required
to demonstrate the ability to exploit vulnerabilities or verify exploits when not feasible. The penetration test
should not be strictly limited to automated scanning techniques, but manual techniques as well. A 3PAO’s penetration testing methodology and report should provide an AO with a clear picture of attack
models leveraged against the authorized system. The report should outline the specific attack narratives of
verification and validation of vulnerabilities identified during testing.</div><div id="chunk-6" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> This requirement will ensure that the

approach and attack models were properly met. While not a comprehensive list, the goal of penetration

FedRAMP realizes that the goal of testing to attain all of the above is not feasible for every CSO. It is up to
CSPs and 3PAOs to determine the tactics and techniques that most assuredly could affect the particular
1 https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/

FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
system. FedRAMP relies extensively on a 3PAO’s penetration testing expertise to identify and test the most
applicable tactics that would be adopted by a malicious actor. 3PAOs should explain the rationale for
choosing the specific penetration testing tactics for the system. A CSP should be aware that an AO may
ask for additional testing during the review if common tactics for a CSO are not tested. This can delay the
time for FedRAMP authorization. 3.0. Attack Vectors
Attack vectors are defined as potential avenues of compromise that may lead to a loss or degradation of
system integrity, confidentiality, or availability. FedRAMP has identified and developed several risk
scenarios for 3PAOs to review and address during penetration testing.</div><div id="chunk-7" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> CSPs and 3PAOs should agree on
the attack vectors. If a specific attack vector cannot be performed, the deviation must be included in the
SAR as a deviation from the Penetration Testing Guidance. CSPs must understand that a 3PAO might see
non-conformance to testing a particular attack vector as a High Risk finding in the SAR Risk Exposure
Table (RET). If a CSP feels strongly that testing the attack vector may result in a significant negative impact
to the production system, then the CSP is encouraged to submit a non-conformance justification for why a
3PAO-recommended attack vector cannot be tested, to an AO. CSPs and 3PAOs must both be aware that
any deviations or non-conformance to established guidance may result in a longer time to FedRAMP
authorization due to the time required for an AO to understand and agree to the deviation or
non-conformance. 3.1 Mandatory Attack Vectors
Techniques to test each system may vary depending on the service offering (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and
Hybrid). Due to system commonalities, the following are mandatory attack vectors for all authorized
systems:
●
External to Corporate
●
External to CSP Target System
●
Tenant to CSP Management System
●
Tenant to Tenant
●
Mobile Application to Target System
●
Client-side Application and/or Agents to Target System
3.1.1 Attack Vector 1: External to Corporate
The External to Corporate attack vector requires the execution of a social engineering (phishing) attack
against a CSP’s system administrators, and managing personnel who may influence system
fedramp.gov
page 5
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
administrators. If sampling is performed, it must be documented in the ROE and approved by an AO prior
to test execution. An attackers’ originating IPs and email domains will be allowed on all perimeter security
devices such as firewalls, web application firewalls, SPAM filters, and intrusion protection systems. Email Phish Campaign
A phishing test is a coordinated assessment between a 3PAO and CSP.</div><div id="chunk-8" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The intent is to test user
compliance, not email security. Users are the last line of defense and should be tested. Emails should be
allow-listed on all security systems and be presented to the user unflagged, unmodified, and unaltered in
any way. 3PAOs must coordinate with CSP security teams to ensure testing is not manipulated in any way. CSP
users that are in-scope for this attack vector are all users with access to CSP management, authorized
systems, applications, or support systems. Additionally, any system administrators with privileged level
access to CSP management endpoints should be considered in-scope of this assessment. 3PAOs are authorized to coordinate with CSPs to utilize established user phishing programs to facilitate
testing. 3PAOs will provide or approve email templates and landing pages used in testing. 3PAOs must
either perform this attack vector themselves, or independently evaluate the effectiveness of a third party
phishing campaign. Landing pages for CSP personnel who are victims of the phishing attack should immediately identify that
the email was a phish, and provide supplemental information on how to identify phishing attacks in the
future.</div><div id="chunk-9" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The email campaign will consist of the following:
●
Email with user name in body
●
Link to landing page
●
Ability to capture emails opened (hidden pixel)
●
Landing page
●
Ability to tie landing page visits by user
●
Username and password capture
●
Ability to track user submission
False positives created by CSP security systems, e.g. sandboxing and link clicking, are to be included in
totals due to requirements of CSPs to bypass these protections. 3PAOs should not keep credentials and
must destroy them after the test due to privacy and security risks. FedRAMP requires that the 3PAO report
back roles and/or metrics but not specific names. CSPs should also require all passwords changed
post-test. Any data submitted to the application, real or not, is to be considered a failure of the test. Metrics for failures and severity can be based on the most current Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) and the 3PAO expertise. For instance, the number of clicks and credential submissions should be
reported along with the 3PAO justification for the scoring. fedramp.gov
page 6
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
Non-Credentialed-Based Phishing Attack
Determine if a user can run an untrusted PowerShell or Bash script. In this type of attack, the scripts could
gather the local username and hostname of the machine and send the payload back to a 3PAO server.</div><div id="chunk-10" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> This shows that remote code execution is possible. 3PAOs are not required to capture credentials but
should track items such as when the script was run, under what circumstances was it run, and the role
allowed to run it. Credential harvesting is not the goal of the phishing attack. If successful or not successful,
a 3PAO can provide evidence of a macro or script execution in lieu of credentials. 3.1.2. Attack Vector 2: External to CSP Target System
The External to CSP Target System attack vector simulates and tests vulnerabilities from external threat
actors and untrusted Internet-based attacks; internal threats such as weak permissions/access controls
and abuse of system services; and poor customer separation measures (e.g., improper network
segmentation and poor implementation of security controls). Internal Threats
CISA states that “Insider threats present a complex and dynamic risk affecting the public and private
domains of all critical infrastructure sectors.”2 Insider threats are unintentional or intentional. CISA defines
the unintentional and intentional threats very clearly. These threats are synopsized here for ease of use. Unintentional Threat (Negligence, Accidental)
Human beings are one of the biggest threat vectors to any computing device.</div><div id="chunk-11" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Human beings are
sometimes impatient, careless, tired, make mistakes, and procrastinate. Negligence is the failure to exercise reasonable care or due diligence. Most insider threats are the result of
actions by people who actually understand the reason for physical and logical security. These people think
security is for the lesser population and deliberately choose to ignore basic security principles. For instance,
these people may choose to ignore a security update because it is inconvenient. Accidental threats are mostly carried out mistakenly, but can be the result of a negligent event. We look at
accidental threats as caused by those people who mistakenly introduce risk to an organization. Mainly,
this accidental threat happens because a person does not understand security principles and applications. For instance, this type of person may not understand privacy data and could send a list of employee Social
Security Numbers as an unencrypted attachment to an external email. Or this might be because a person
unknowingly forwards an email thread with sensitive company data to a business competitor.</div><div id="chunk-12" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> This type of
person may love to forward email attachments or jokes to others and not realize that the attachment
contains malware. Intentional Threats
Intentional threats are purposefully harmful to another person or an organization. These threats are the
result of malcontents or disgruntled employees. Malcontents cause issues because they seek to disrupt life
in general because of some internal rebellion. Disgruntled employees may cause issues because they feel
2 https://www.cisa.gov/defining-insider-threats
fedramp.gov

FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
they were treated unfairly. These types of people may try to sabotage equipment, or inflict other types of
disruptions and violence. Other people may steal proprietary data or intellectual property in the false hope
of advancing their career. Other Threats
Additional threats include collusion, third-party actors, and direct and indirect threats. 3PAOs and CSPs are
urged to consider each type of insider threat and determine how to best test the CSO to minimize these
threats. Poor Separation Measures and Defense In Depth
Applications and systems currently exposed to the public internet should be tested and risk-assigned
based on the footprint provided as part of the external boundary of the information system.</div><div id="chunk-13" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Application,
API, and services testing should be done in sessions or a “less than ideal scenario” where all external
endpoints are known to an attacker. Additionally, all passive or active blocking security devices, such as
web application firewalls and or software-based security controls, will be bypassed to facilitate testing. “Attack Vector 2” may be tested along with “Attack Vector 3” and “Attack Vector 4”, as long as all attack
scenarios are covered and user/management experiences do not differ. 3PAOs are also required to elevate
risk ratings higher for compromise scenarios originating from public access. ●
IaaS – Testing should originate from public internet attacking exterior IPs or URLs used to host or
manage authorized systems. This should include out-of-band, break glass, VPNs, or site-to-site
connection interfaces (non-authenticated). 3PAOs should take into consideration corporate shared
services and systems and the direct or indirect impact exploitation of these may have on Federal
Government data and metadata. These systems usually reside on CSP “corporate networks” and
the interconnections should be assessed due to their impact on the accredited system. ●
PaaS – Testing should originate from public internet attacking exterior IPs or URLs used to host
and manage authorized systems and within the application or applicable database. ●
SaaS – Testing should originate from public internet attacking exterior IPs or URLs used to host
and manage authorized systems and within the application or applicable database.</div><div id="chunk-14" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> 3.1.3. Attack Vector 3: Tenant to CSP Management System
This Tenant to CSP Management System attack vector simulates and tests vulnerabilities, untrusted
internal threats, and trusted internal threats that emanate from network threat actors, application threat
actors, and abuse of services of the authorized system. This attack vector is performed by conducting a full application test attempting to access CSP
management systems due to misconfiguration, flaw in system design, abuse of intended function,
low-code or no-code software deployment, and/or command line interface (CLI) that allows access to the
CSP management zone. fedramp.gov
page 8
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
Privileged and Unprivileged Users
CSPs will provide privileged level accounts to applications within the production environment in order to
facilitate and identify scenarios where the attacker may go from unauthenticated access to authenticated
access to privileged level access. All Tenant to CSP Management System attacks are to be conducted using
the highest level of permissions available to customer users of the information system. The intent is to
identify any opportunity that privileged customer accounts would have to compromise the underlying
system architecture. While cloud providers may prefer to evaluate a tenant within the development/test environments, these are
rarely identical to the production deployment, and will not be used as a valid representation for the
FedRAMP penetration test vectors. A CSP’s production environment should be sufficiently resilient to
sustain a FedRAMP penetration test. ●
IaaS – Testing should originate from hosted Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service, server, or platform. Agents, APIs, and applications that allow for communications between tenant space and
infrastructure or platform layers are in scope to ensure host compromise is limited to VPC or
platform.</div><div id="chunk-15" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> ●
PaaS – Testing should originate from the platform provided and attempt to gain access to
lower-level PaaS management systems or IaaS level systems. Due to inherent PaaS
customizations and modifications (based on the Service Level Agreement [SLA]), the probability
that the PaaS implementation may affect the security of underlying IaaS is high. Automated code
deployment tools or CLIs to deploy SaaS solutions are considered in-scope and are required to be
tested. ●
SaaS – Testing should originate from an application, API, or CLI if provided as a tool that is
presented as part of an authorized system. 3.1.4. Attack Vector 4: Tenant-to-Tenant
This attack vector simulates and tests vulnerabilities from untrusted internal threats and trusted internal
threats that emanate from issues such as ransomware spread from government and multi organization
access to the authorized system. This attack vector is performed by conducting a full application test which attempts to use provisional
access of one tenant to compromise another tenant. Environments are required to be set up to test all
aspects of the service provided, to include authentication, data access, user permissions, and sessions. Access to the cloud service offering should mirror the methods used by system customers. 3PAOs should
be provisioned with two full production customer tenants for performing the Tenant-to-Tenant attack
vector.</div><div id="chunk-16" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> fedramp.gov
page 9
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
3.1.5. Attack Vector 5: Mobile Application to Target System
The Mobile Application to Target System attack vector consists of emulating a mobile application user
attempting to access a CSP target system or CSP management system. This attack vector is tested on a
representative mobile device and does not directly impact a CSP target system or infrastructure. Information derived from this activity can be used to inform testing of other attack vectors. If a mobile
application is not part of a CSP’s CSO, then this attack vector can be marked as out-of-scope. 3.1.6 Attack Vector 6: Client-side Application and/or Agents to Target System
For this attack vector, if a CSP provides client-side components (i.e., components installed locally within a
customer environment), those components must be included in the CSP's authorization boundary and
tested as part of a CSP's system boundary security assessment if the components are essential for their
customer's use of their CSO. Such client-side applications or components may include (though not
exclusively) software applications, servers, appliances, browser extensions, thick clients, and agents. If a
CSP provides optional-use, client-side components, such components may be included in the CSP's tested
authorization boundary, if agreed upon between the CSP and customer. CSPs should include in their SSP, and 3PAOs in their testing, any controls out of a customer's ability to
remediate such as encryption and software development. It is recognized that many of these controls will
have a significant customer responsibility.</div><div id="chunk-17" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> These shared responsibilities should be clearly called out in the
SSP and assessed by a 3PAO. FedRAMP encourages inclusion of optional-use components within a CSP's tested boundary as it reduces
the burden on customers for component assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring. When scoping the system boundaries for the assessment, it is important to consider the legal ramifications
of performing penetration testing activities on third-party environments. All testing activities must be
limited to the in-scope test boundary for the system to ensure adherence to all agreements and to limit
legal liability. Penetration testing should not be performed on assets for which permission has not been
explicitly documented. Obtaining permissions for any third-party assets are required to be in-scope and
are a CSP’s responsibility. 4.0. Scoping the Penetration Test
The authorization boundaries of a proposed cloud service will be initially determined based on the SSP and
attachments. Section 9 of the SSP should clearly define authorization boundaries of the cloud system in a
diagram and in words. During penetration test scoping discussions, individual system components will be
reviewed and deemed as “in-scope” or “out-of-scope” for the penetration test.</div><div id="chunk-18" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> The aggregate of the agreed
upon and authorized in-scope components will comprise the system boundary for the penetration test. fedramp.gov

FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
When scoping the system boundaries for an assessment, it is important to consider the legal ramifications
of performing penetration testing activities on third-party environments. All testing activities must be
limited to the in-scope test boundary for the system to ensure adherence to all agreements and to limit
legal liability. Penetration testing should not be performed on assets for which permission has not been
explicitly documented. Obtaining permissions for any third-party assets are required to be in-scope and is
a CSP’s responsibility. Service models intending to use FedRAMP Authorized services lower in the “cloud stack” can leverage the
FedRAMP compliance and security features of those services. As a result, attack vectors already addressed
by other FedRAMP Authorized services lower in the “cloud stack” are not required to be re-evaluated. For
example, if a PaaS and SaaS leverage another layer (i.e., IaaS) that is FedRAMP Authorized, then
penetration testing of the lower layer is not required. However, a CSP must determine the authorization
system boundaries and provide justification for any controls they intend to claim as inherited from the
supporting service. If the PaaS and/or SaaS are including FedRAMP Authorized security features for the
lower layers, then penetration testing of the lower layers is required and a CSP needs to obtain all the
authorizations required for a 3PAO to perform penetration testing for the lower layers.</div><div id="chunk-19" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Penetration testing may require:
●
Negotiation and agreement with third parties such as internet service providers (ISPs), managed
security service providers (MSSPs), facility leaseholders, hosting services, and/or other
organizations involved in, or affected by, the test. In such scenarios, a CSP is responsible for
coordination and obtaining approvals from third parties prior to the commencement of testing. ●
When a cloud system has multiple tenants, CSPs must build a temporary tenant environment if
another tenant environment suitable for testing does not exist. Use of production to development
instances to meet multi-tenancy may be used if a 3PAO validates attack vectors and models are
effectively tested. 5.0 Rules of Engagement (ROE)
The penetration test plan must include:
●
A description of the approach, constraints, and methodologies for each planned attack. ●
A detailed test schedule that specifies the start and end date/times and content of each test period
and the overall penetration test beginning and end dates. ●
Technical points of contact (POC) with a backup for each subsystem and/or application that may
be included in the penetration test. The penetration test ROE describes the target systems, scope, constraints, and proper notifications and
disclosures of the penetration test. 3PAOs develop a ROE based on the parameters provided by a CSP. The
fedramp.gov
page 11
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
ROE must be developed in accordance with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-115, Appendix B, and be
approved by an AO prior to testing.</div><div id="chunk-20" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Additionally, NIST SP 800-115, Section 7, Security Assessment
Execution states, "appropriate personnel such as the CIO, CISO, and ISSO are informed of any critical
high-impact vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered." FedRAMP requires that the ROE must contain
this clause and include the AO, in addition to the CIO, CISO, and ISSO. See Section 6, Rules of Engagement,
of the FedRAMP Security Assessment Plan Template for more information on the ROE. 3PAOs must include
a copy of the ROE in the FedRAMP Security Assessment Plan submitted to FedRAMP. The ROE should also include:
●
Local computer incident response team or capability and their requirements for exercising the
penetration test
●
Physical penetration constraints
●
Acceptable social engineering pretext(s) to be fully worked out prior to the ROE being signed. Note:
○
Social engineering tests are based upon a 3PAO’s expertise in challenging a CSP’s users’
failures to follow documented CSO policies and procedures
○
Can be evaluated against the effectiveness of a CSP’s security awareness and training
program
○
There is no “one size fits all” social engineering testing. 3PAOs should consider the threats,
at the time of testing, and incorporate these methods, as applicable, into their penetration
testing methodology. A summary and reference to any third-party agreements, including POCs for third parties that may be
affected by the penetration test and must be included in the documentation. The time to authorization will
be extended if the additional testing is required to be done based on an AOs review and prior to FedRAMP
authorizing the package. 3PAOs are required to fully document, in the Penetration Testing Report section
6.0, the rationale behind a CSP not agreeing to a social engineering test.</div><div id="chunk-21" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Also, CSPs are encouraged to
report to FedRAMP any proposed 3PAO penetration testing exercises that seem too severe given the
nature of the CSO being offered. 6.0. Reporting
Penetration test assessment activities and results must be organized and compiled into a comprehensive
penetration test report to be included in the SAR. There is no template provided for the penetration test
report. The penetration test report should include appropriate confidentiality and sensitivity markings in
compliance with a CSP’s organizational policy. 3PAOs should provide the report to a CSP via a secure
means in compliance with the CSP organization’s policies. Any information included in the report that could
fedramp.gov
page 12
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
contain sensitive data (screenshots, tables, figures) must be sanitized, or masked, using techniques that
render the sensitive data permanently unrecoverable by recipients of the report. 3PAOs must not include
passwords (including those in encrypted form) in the final report or must mask them to ensure recipients of
the report cannot recreate or guess the password. The report is required to address the following sections, but not necessarily in this order:
6.1. Scope of Target System
Outline the target system that was assessed and if any deviations were made from the ROE/TP document.</div><div id="chunk-22" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> 6.2. Attack Vectors Assessed During the
Penetration Test
Describe the attack vector(s) tested and the threat model(s) followed for executing the penetration test. 6.3. Timeline for Assessment Activity
Document when penetration testing activity was performed. 6.4. Actual Tests Performed and Results
Document the actual tests performed to address the penetration test requirements outlined in this
document and document the results of each test. 6.5. Findings and Evidence
Findings should include a description of the issue, the impact on the target system, a recommendation to
the CSP, a risk rating, and relevant evidence to provide context for each finding. fedramp.gov
page 13
FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
6.6. Access Paths
Access paths are the chain of attack vectors, exploitations, and post-exploitations that lead to a
degradation of system integrity, confidentiality, or availability.</div><div id="chunk-23" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> 3PAOs must describe the access path and
the penetration test impact if multiple vulnerabilities could be coupled to form a sophisticated attack
against a CSP. 7.0. Testing Schedule Requirements
For each initial security authorization, a penetration test must be completed by a 3PAO as a part of the
assessment process described in the SAP. This initial penetration test must be performed no more than 6
months prior to the submission of the SAR. Once within the continuous monitoring phase of the FedRAMP
process, additional penetration testing activities must be performed at least every 12 months, unless
otherwise approved by an authorizing body with documented rationale. 8.0. Third Party Assessment Organizations
(3PAO) Staffing Requirements
All penetration test activities must be performed by a 3PAO that has demonstrated penetration testing
proficiency and maintains a defined penetration test methodology. The penetration test team lead must
have an industry-recognized credential for penetration testing and equivalent education and experience as
required in the R311 Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP): Specific
Requirements. fedramp.gov

                        <div class="accordion-content"><p>Sure, here’s a practical checklist for a project manager to ensure a web application project complies with the FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance standards:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Identify Scope:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Define the system boundary based on the SSP.</li>
<li>List all components, services, and internal/external access paths.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Contract a 3PAO:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure the selection of a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO for conducting penetration tests.</li>
<li>Obtain agreement from relevant stakeholders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Rules of Engagement (ROE):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Define and document the procedures, constraints, and methodologies for penetration testing.</li>
<li>Include local incident response and evidence handling procedures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Organize Key Personnel:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Assign and document roles such as System Owner, Trusted Agent, Penetration Test Team Lead, and Team Members.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing Schedule:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Develop and approve a detailed schedule for penetration testing activities.</li>
<li>Specify start/end dates for different testing phases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Coordinate Permissions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Obtain necessary permissions from all third parties involved such as ISPs and MSSPs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop Penetration Test Plan:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure the test plan includes attack vector tactics, scope, and rationale.</li>
<li>Address mandatory attack vectors: External to Corporate, External to CSP Target System, Tenant to CSP Management System, Tenant to Tenant, Mobile Application to Target System, Client-side Application and/or Agents to Target System.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Threat Model Implementation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use threat models to define the focus of the penetration tests.</li>
<li>Ensure the use of current adversarial tactics (e.g., MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform Penetration Tests:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure the penetration tests are executed according to the approved plan.</li>
<li>Conduct tasks like phishing attacks, exploitation attempts, and vulnerability assessments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reporting and Documentation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Collect penetration test results and ensure they are documented comprehensively.</li>
<li>Sanitize sensitive data and formalize findings, recommendations, and access paths for the final report.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Approval:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Review all findings with stakeholders.</li>
<li>Obtain approval on deviations from standard practices (if any) from the Authorizing Official (AO).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Remediation Plan:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Develop and track an action plan for addressing identified vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Monitor continuous improvements and security measure updates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>By following these steps, the project manager can organize and track compliance activities effectively to ensure FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance adherence for the web application.</p>
