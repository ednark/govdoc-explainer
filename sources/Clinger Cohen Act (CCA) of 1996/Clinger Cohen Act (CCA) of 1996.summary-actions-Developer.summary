To ensure compliance with the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 from the perspective of a Drupal developer tasked with implementing backend business logic in a web application, here's a streamlined action list:

1. **Assess and Validate Needs:** Confirm that the application development aligns with the federal agency's enterprise architecture to ensure that the project supports the agency’s missions effectively. 

2. **Cost-Effectiveness Documentation:** Maintain a record indicating that the technology solutions chosen (e.g., using Drupal) offer cost-effective improvements to process efficiencies. Document comparisons and evaluations if alternatives were considered.

3. **Performance Measures:** Define and integrate performance measures into the application logic. These should reveal how the application boosts the performance of business processes it's designed to assist.

4. **Security and Privacy Integrations:** Implement necessary security measures in line with government requirements such as data encryption, user authentication, and privacy standards to protect sensitive information.

5. **Modular Development:** Leverage Drupal’s modular capabilities to ensure individual components of the web application can be upgraded or replaced independently without affecting overall operations, adhering to modernization priorities outlined by the government.

6. **Documentation and Reporting:** Keep thorough documentation of all stages of the development process, decisions made, and methodologies used. Regularly update relevant government stakeholders or bodies overseeing the project.

7. **Compliance with Federal Frameworks:** Align with specific federal IT management frameworks and guidelines that are invoked by the act (such as FISMA compliance for security).

By focusing on these areas, you help ensure that the web application will comply with the requirements of the Clinger-Cohen Act.
