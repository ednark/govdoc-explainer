To ensure compliance with the Clinger Cohen Act (1996) in the context of managing a project for a web application development, the following actions should be prioritized:

1. **Ensure Alignment with Federal Objectives:** Verify that the web application project aligns with the specific federal agency's goals and IT objectives, enhancing its performance and efficiency.

2. **Adopt Capital Planning and Investment Control:** Implement and maintain a framework for IT investment management to ensure that the project delivers value, is completed within budget, and meets federal financial management guidelines.

3. **Perform Benefit-Cost Analysis:** Conduct a detailed analysis to demonstrate that the project provides a positive return on investment (ROI) and aligns with strategic priorities of the federal agency.

4. **Meet Performance Goals:** Define clear performance metrics for the web application to ensure it meets federal performance requirements. Regularly report on these metrics to stakeholders.

5. **Review Risk Management Processes:** Establish and maintain an effective risk management process tailored to the specifics of the IT project, considering potential pitfalls specific to technology deployments in governmental environments.

6. **Adhere to Federal IT Standards:** Comply with specific federal IT standards and requirements, including security protocols, accessibility standards as per the American Disabilities Act, and data protection laws.

7. **Achieve Milestone Deliverables:** Organize project milestones, closely track progress, and maintain periodic check-ins with stakeholders to ensure the project stays on track and compliant.

8. **Maintain Documentation and Reporting:** Keep detailed records of all project activities, decisions, and compliance checks. Regularly update and circulate this documentation among project stakeholders.

These actions, while ensuring compliance with the Clinger Cohen Act, also contribute to the effective governance and successful delivery of IT projects within the federal government setting.
