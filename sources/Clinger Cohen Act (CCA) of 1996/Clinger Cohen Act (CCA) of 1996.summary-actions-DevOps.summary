To ensure compliance with the Government Standards Document Section 2.2 Clinger Cohen Act as a DevOps technician involved in supporting web applications for government use, focus on the following key actions:

1. **Establish Efficient IT Management Practices**: Set up and maintain highly effective management processes for the design, development, and deployment of the web application. This includes proper documentation, revision control, and continuous improvement protocols to ensure all updates and changes align with regulatory and security standards.

2. **Adopt Value-Driven IT Investment Practices**: Facilitate processes and practices that assess the value and impact of IT investments in the web application against their costs. Implement tools and methodologies that help in measuring performance and justify the investment based on benefits to the agency and the public.

3. **Ensure Implementation of Performance and Results-based Management**: Implement monitoring and reporting tools to systematically track and evaluate the performance of the web application. Use auto-scaling, real-time monitoring, and analytics to manage and predict infrastructure needs effectively.

4. **Technology Resource Optimization**: Regularly audit technology resources to ensure there is no redundancy, and resources are optimally used. This involves scaling server resources, optimizing load balancing, and considering cloud services when appropriate for cost efficiency and performance optimization.

5. **Risk Management**: Implement strict security protocols to address vulnerabilities and protect data integrity and privacy. Use automated security tools for continuous threat detection and response mechanisms. Also, perform regularly scheduled risk assessments and update response strategies accordingly.

6. **Documentation and Reporting Compliance**: Maintain comprehensive and up-to-TTP documentation practices that detail procedural updates, changes, and compliance measures. Prepare reports as required by government departments to demonstrate compliance and operational transparency of IT services.

7. **Support Provisions for Accessibility and Usability**: Ensure that the web applications comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, making them accessible to people with disabilities. This includes adherence to web accessibility guidelines and usability testing specifically targeted at accessibility.

8. **Training and Development**: Develop and provide ongoing training programs for your team and associated stakeholders to stay updated on new technologies, security practices, and government IT compliance requirements.

Incorporating these actions systematically as part of the workflow will help ensure that any web application project meets the necessary governmental compliance standards as outlined by the Clinger Cohen Act and the broader government standards focused on effective and efficient use of IT resources.
