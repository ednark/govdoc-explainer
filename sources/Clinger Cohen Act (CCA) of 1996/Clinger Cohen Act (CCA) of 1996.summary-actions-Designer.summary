To comply with Clinger-Cohen Act (1996) from a design perspective, particularly focusing on Human Centered Design for web applications, follow these key actions:

1. **User-Centric Evaluation**: Regularly assess and ensure that the design meets the actual needs of users rather than simply being technologically feasible. This involves validating user requirements and expectations through surveys, interviews, usability testing, and other feedback mechanisms.

2. **Efficiency in Design**: Ensure the design of the application enhances the efficiency of the operation it supports. This could be through streamlined navigation, optimized workflows, or other functional improvements that save time and reduce errors for end-users.

3. **Accessibility Compliance**: Adhere to accessibility standards under laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. This mandates that web applications must be accessible to users with disabilities, employing designs that support assistive technologies like screen readers, high contrast modes, and keyboard navigation.

4. **Design Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation of the design process and decisions. This should include the rationale for design choices, how these choices address user needs, and how they contribute to the operational effectiveness of the application. 

5. **Security Integration in Design**: Embed security measures into the design from the early stages. Ensure that user interfaces do not expose sensitive information unnecessarily and provide clear user controls for privacy settings.

6. **Performance Metrics**: Establish and utilize performance metrics to monitor the usability and effectiveness of the application. Metrics should focus on user satisfaction, task completion rates, error rates, and other relevant indicators of user-centered performance.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Implement a routine process for revisiting and refining the user interface and user experience based on evolving user feedback, technical innovations, and changes in user needs.

8. **Training Materials**: Develop user-friendly training materials that help users understand how to interact with the application effectively, optimizing their experience and the applicationâ€™s overall usability.

These actions, centered around a strong commitment to human-centered design principles, ensure compliance with the Clinger-Cohen Act by directly addressing the efficiency and effectiveness of IT solutions in meeting user needs and organizational goals.
