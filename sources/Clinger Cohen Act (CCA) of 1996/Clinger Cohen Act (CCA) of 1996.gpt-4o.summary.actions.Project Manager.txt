To ensure compliance with the Clinger Cohen Act (1996) for a web application project from a Project Manager's perspective, focus on tracking and organizing the following minimal actions:

1. **Establish IT Governance**: Define roles and responsibilities for IT governance within the project.

2. **Performance Measurement**: Develop metrics to assess the performance and progress of the web application.

3. **Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC)**: Make sure the project is justified with cost-benefit analyses and investment reviews.

4. **Risk Management**: Identify, assess, and integrate risk management strategies early in the project.

5. **Security Assessment**: Ensure compliance with security requirements through regular security assessments.

6. **User Needs Assessment**: Engage stakeholders to define and confirm user requirements and expectations.

7. **Lifecycle Management**: Implement a lifecycle management plan covering development, deployment, and maintenance.

8. **Integration and Interoperability**: Ensure the web application can integrate and work with other government systems.

9. **Documentation Standards**: Maintain thorough and compliant documentation throughout the project's lifecycle.

10. **Training and Support**: Provide necessary training and support plans for end-users.

11. **Review and Approval Process**: Set up a structured review and approval process to ensure alignment with government standards.

Regularly update the project plan to reflect progress and any changes in compliance requirements.
