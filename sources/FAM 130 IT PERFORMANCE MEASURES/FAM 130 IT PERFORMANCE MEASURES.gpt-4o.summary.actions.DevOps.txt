For a DevOps technician tasked with ensuring that the web application infrastructure complies with government standards, here is a minimal list of actions:

1. **Establish Benchmarks**:
   - Set up performance benchmarks for evaluating system efficiency and effectiveness.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Implement performance metrics defined in **5 FAM 674** for assessing business results.

3. **PRM Usage**:
   - Use the latest Performance Reference Model (PRM) from the OMB to develop performance measures.

4. **Annual Baselines**:
   - Establish and document annual performance baselines for the infrastructure.

5. **Improvement Goals**:
   - Develop specific, measurable improvement goals for the infrastructure based on annual performance.

6. **CPIC Reporting**:
   - Ensure all performance metrics and improvements are reported through the CPIC system managed by the E-Gov PMO.

7. **Accountability**:
   - Implement performance measures that increase accountability for infrastructure investments.

8. **Audit Compliance**:
