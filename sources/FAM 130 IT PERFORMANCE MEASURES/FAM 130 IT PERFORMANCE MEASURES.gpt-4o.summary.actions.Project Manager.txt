Certainly, from the perspective of a Project Manager, here are the minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with the government standards for a web application project:

1. **Review Strategic Alignment**:
   - Confirm the project's objectives align with the Department's mission and strategic goals.

2. **Develop IT Performance Measurement Plan**:
   - Create a performance measurement plan that includes specific, measurable goals and benchmarks.

3. **Utilize the Performance Reference Model (PRM)**:
   - Ensure the performance measures are developed using the OMB's PRM for consistency and comparability.

4. **Establish Annual Performance Baselines**:
   - Set annual performance baselines for the web applications and define measurable improvements.

5. **Implement Performance Metrics**:
   - Use performance metrics to track “business results” and evaluate how well IT program goals are being met.

6. **Adhere to Reporting Requirements**:
   - Ensure all relevant performance data is reported through the Department’s electronic CPIC system.

7. **Document Accountability**:
   - Maintain documentation that assigns accountability for IT investments, detailing roles and responsibilities.

8. **Monitor and Report Progress**:
   - Regularly monitor performance and report results to ensure the project meets its annual program performance goals.

9. **Review Legislative Compliance**:
   - Ensure compliance with relevant legislative requirements (GPRA, GPRAMA, Clinger-Cohen Act).

10. **Update Joint Strategic Plan**:
    - Verify updates to the State and USAID Joint Strategic Plan are reflected in the project’s objectives and execution.

By following these steps, the project manager can ensure that the web application project adheres to the required government standards and meets relevant performance and reporting obligations.
