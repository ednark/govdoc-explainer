DevSecOps Continuous Authorization to Operate 
Evaluation Criteria 
 
Executive Summary 
To maintain a competitive advantage, the Department of Defense (DoD) must develop and 
deploy software with increasing speed and agility, while improving security. Additionally, the 
DoD must respond quickly to rapidly changing threats through the continuous integration and 
delivery of capabilities, cybersecurity, resiliency, and survivability. The Department 
accomplishes this using DevSecOps practices for software development. Software factories 
(SWF) that use DevSecOps practices can mitigate threats early during software development as 
well as during operations. To allow software delivery organizations to deploy more secure 
software faster, the Department will implement a new approach to system authorizations: 
Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO).</div><div id="chunk-1" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) is a modernized authorization process designed to 
work with software delivery organizations that want to move faster and are willing to adopt the 
necessary culture change. cATO moves away from solely a document-based, point-in-time 
technical security assessment approach (though some point-in-time documents are still required), 
towards focusing on a continuous risk determination and authorization concept by continuously 
assessing, monitoring, and managing risk. cATO raises the security standard over a traditional 
Authorization to Operate (ATO) and provides the ability to deploy software more rapidly to the 
field while improving security. (See Glossary for a more precise definition of cATO.) A software factory with a cATO is allowed to continuously develop, assess, and deploy software 
that meets the risk tolerances laid out within a system authorization boundary. A DevSecOps cATO is based on continual assessment of the processes, the skills of its SWF 
teams, and the use of a DevSecOps Platform that meets one of the DoD Enterprise DevSecOps 
Reference Designs, and which implements continuous monitoring, active cyber defense, and the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) secure supply chain guidance. Overview 
This cATO Evaluation Criteria establishes the use cases and guidelines for evaluating a request 
for continuous authorization for a software factory (for an explanation of a DevSecOps platform 
and software factory, see DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals). Additionally, it provides the recommended processes and information required for software 
factories to generate a cATO package and send to DCIO(CS) for review and approval. Appendix 
A outlines the two use cases for which requesting a DevSecOps (DSO) cATO is appropriate. Appendix B highlights the baseline guidance and assessment overview as well as the specific 
information required for the cATO package.</div><div id="chunk-2" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Please note that due to evolving requirements, this

Appendix A: DevSecOps Continuous Authorization to Operate: Scope for General Use 
Cases  
Programs or software factories applying for a DSO cATO should already be in one of the 
following use case categories. Use Case 1 (Inside the Software Factory Boundary): A software factory uses a development, 
security, and operations (DevSecOps) platform that already has an ATO. Software is developed 
in that factory and deployed within its production environment (i.e., within its system boundary) 
as depicted in Figure 1. The software factory seeks a cATO that includes its production 
environment. This is the main use case for a SWF leveraging cATO. Example: Software 
developed and put into production using the Platform One (P1) Party Bus. (Note: Information 
flow includes development, test, and security artifacts). Figure 1.</div><div id="chunk-3" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Single Authorization Boundary 
Use Case 2 (Outside the SWF Boundary): A software factory using a DevSecOps platform that 
already has an ATO, but the software is deployed into another authorization boundary (e.g., a 
weapon system) with its own ATO as depicted in Figure 2. The software factory seeks a cATO 
for the factory that allows deployment into the production environment. This involves at least 
two authorization boundaries and there must be agreements in place to pass software across the 
boundary and subsequently pass results and feedback back to the software factory. Example: The 
Forge Software Factory has an ATO to build software that is then deployed on Navy ships, each 
of which have their own ATOs. UNCLASSIFIED

Figure 2. Multiple Authorization Boundaries 
An outcome of issuing a cATO for use case 2 is to seamlessly deliver software factory products 
into the production environment through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and an 
Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA). Figure 3 shows the DevSecOps continuous lifecycle and the delineation between the software 
factory that is primarily responsible for creating the software product and the associated 
production environment where the software will execute. (Note: the outer path shows steps in the 
Risk Management Framework (RMF) process, but this diagram does not directly map these to 
the lifecycle phases. All the RMF steps must be followed, and the system must be in the 
Monitor phase of RMF, before a system can apply for a cATO.) Figure 3.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Software Factory/Production Boundary

Appendix B: DevSecOps Continuous Authorization: Implementation Guidance and 
Evaluation Criteria 
While the DoD RMF Knowledge Service is the authoritative source for cATO implementation 
guidance, this appendix provides an overview of how to assess a SWF for cATO along with the 
requirements to deploy applications outside of the SWF authorization boundary in accordance 
with DoD ISCM Strategy. Figure 4 depicts an overview of the cATO assessment method. The top row shows the related 
RMF steps: prepare, assess, authorize, and monitor. Other RMF steps (i.e., categorize, select, and 
implement) take place outside the review process. The next row, with chevrons, indicates the 
steps taken during the cATO assessment: identify assessors, develop an assessment plan, assess 
the DevSecOps Platform (DSOP), assess the SWF teams, assess the DSO processes, develop a 
cATO authorization recommendation, authorize the cATO, and constantly monitor the risk. Figure 4. Assessment Method Overview 
Software Factory practices required for cATO are informed by the existing RMF authorization to 
operate assessment and the implementation of continuous monitoring. This assumes that before 
applying for a cATO, the software factory has already progressed into the monitoring phase of 
RMF and has a valid ATO. The cATO assessment further evaluates the ‘Prepare’, ‘Assess’, and 
‘Authorize’ RMF phases. However, the key to receiving a cATO is having a robust continuous 
monitoring strategy that includes automated triggers based on approved thresholds within the 
auditing and incident response plans. The automated triggers and approved thresholds should 
include both internal and external threats.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Additionally, a complete understanding and 
implementation (or planned implementation) of the shift security left and shield right concept 
that incorporates vulnerability scanning and compliance checking with detection and response 
activities to security incidents in real time. This includes tight integration with a Cybersecurity 
Service Provider (CSSP) and Security Operations Center (SOC) if established. Hosting an 
environment (development, test, staging, production, etc.) on a cloud requires the deployment of 
a Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP). Once the Chief Information Security

Officer (CISO)1 grants a cATO, continuous monitoring practices (including the CSSP) monitor 
the risk. Upon identification of an issue or anomaly, the CSSP, along with the Security Control 
Assessor (SCA), shall investigate and mitigate as necessary. If the issue or anomaly is outside of 
agreed upon thresholds, the CSSP or SCA in collaboration with the Authorizing Official (AO) 
may initiate a review of the cATO. If so, the CISO may decide to revoke the cATO. However, 
with the approval of the originating Component authorizing official, the system can revert to its 
original ATO by kicking off a new workflow in the Component’s RMF Inventory Tool, if the 
cATO is revoked. The approval to implement cATO process within a DevSecOps software factory is granted by 
following the RMF guidelines identified in CNSSI 1253, NIST SP 800-53 and DoDI 8510.01.</div><div id="chunk-6" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> In 
order to receive an approved cATO, the software factory must have a current ATO with no 
‘High’ or ‘Very High’ unmitigated findings. The cATO analysis will review the existing 
authorization, further evaluate the continuous monitoring strategy, ensure active cyber defense is 
implemented properly, assess the DevSecOps and supply chain processes, and validate that they 
are following cybersecurity supply chain risk management guidance in accordance with NIST SP 
800-161r1. 1 Currently, this level of authority is at the DoD-level. Once cATO criteria is standardized for the DevSecOps use 
case, the DoD CISO will delegate approval authority to the Component CISO or equivalent. UNCLASSIFIED

Appendix C: DevSecOps cATO Assessment Overview 
The three competencies in the memo “Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO),” February 
3, 2022, are (1) Continuous Monitoring (CONMON), (2) Active Cyber Defense (ACD) and (3) 
Secure Software Supply Chain (SSSC). However, the assessment of this use case is organized 
into evaluating the DevSecOps Platform, Processes, and People (Teams). This section discusses 
how to reconcile these two sets of concepts. To be considered for cATO, the environment must 
ensure:  
1) The DevSecOps Platform (DSOP) contains essential automation to enable CONMON, 
ACD, and to support DevSecOps (DSO) tooling for a Secure Software Supply Chain 
(SSSC). 2) Processes are defined for people using, operating, and maintaining the DSOP. 3) People are trained on the DSOP and its processes.</div><div id="chunk-7" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The cATO applies to the software factory, which includes the DSOP, and the software produced 
by the software factory. The processes for using the SWF and DSOP must be clear, and the 
people must be familiar with all aspects of DevSecOps. Figure 5 depicts a high-level crosswalk between these two sets of concepts, showing how they 
relate. The main columns represent the three competencies, while the rows show the three 
aspects of the cATO Assessment. Figure 5. cATO Memo Competency Assessment Crosswalk

Appendix D: cATO Evaluation Criteria 
The following list of activities associated with the Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) 
competencies are what the DoD CISO considers when Component CISOs present systems that 
are requesting to move into a cATO state. The presence of these activities will be partly determined through demonstrated use of system-
level dashboards, which are a culmination of information received from logging, testing, and the 
following activities to provide a real-time view of the environment. Components are not limited 
to the way they conduct the following activities; however, this document offers guidelines to 
achieving a cATO. Items in bold in this section indicate documents or artifacts that must be delivered as part of the

Glossary 
Authorization boundary “All components of an information system to be authorized for 
operation by an authorizing official. This excludes separately authorized systems to which the 
information system is connected.” NIST 800-37r2. Authorizing Official (AO) is “a senior Federal official or executive with the authority to 
authorize (i.e., assume responsibility for) the operation of an information system or the use of a 
designated set of common controls at an acceptable level of risk to agency operations (including 
mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, individuals, other organizations, and the 
Nation.” NIST 800-37r2. Authorization to Operate (ATO) is “the official management decision given by a senior 
Federal official or officials to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly 
accept the risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency 
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an 
agreed-upon set of security and privacy controls. Authorization also applies to common controls 
inherited by agency information systems.” NIST 800-37r2. Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) is the state achieved when the organization that 
develops, secures, and operates a system has demonstrated sufficient maturity in their ability to 
maintain a resilient cybersecurity posture that traditional risk assessments and authorizations 
become redundant. This organization must have implemented robust information security 
continuous monitoring capabilities, active cyber defense, and secure software supply chain 
requirements to enable continuous delivery of capabilities without adversely impacting the 
system’s cyber posture. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline is the process workflows and 
associated tools to achieve the continuous integration and continuous delivery of software with 
maximum use of automation. Control gate is a defined point in the project lifecycle when specific requirements, called exit 
criteria, must be met to move to the next phase in the lifecycle.</div><div id="chunk-12" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Exit criteria include functional, 
security, and non-functional criteria. DevSecOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software 
development (Dev), security (Sec) and operations (Ops). The main characteristic of DevSecOps 
is to automate, monitor, and apply security at all phases of software development: plan, develop, 
build, test, release, deliver, deploy, operate, and monitor. DevSecOps Platform (DSOP) is the set of tools and automation that enables a software factory. It includes the ability to create DevSecOps pipelines with control gates, and to deploy software 
into development and test environments. It may also deploy into production, depending on the 
production environment. Use of a DevSecOps platform is encouraged to accelerate development, 
delivery, and authorization. DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Designs for a DSOP may be 
found here. ISCM is defined as “maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and 
threats to support organizational risk management decisions.” NIST SP 800-137. UNCLASSIFIED
