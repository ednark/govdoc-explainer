Certainly! From the perspective of a project manager for a web application aiming to comply with Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO), hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions to track and organize work:

1. **Develop and Document Risk Management Strategy:**
   - Establish risk tolerances based on client guidance.
   - Include threat management processes.

2. **Continuous Monitoring Strategy:**
   - Set timelines for vulnerability assessments.
   - Implement monitoring tools and dashboards.

3. **System Authorization Boundary Diagram:**
   - Document data flows and external connections.

4. **Establish Security Control Gates:**
   - Define control gates and triggers within the DevSecOps pipeline.
   - Implement automation for alerts and responses.

5. **Implement Incident Response Plan:**
   - Define incident response roles and procedures.
   - Schedule and document incident response exercises.

6. **Vulnerability Management:**
   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans.
   - Track and document mitigation actions.

7. **Deploy Active Cyber Defense Mechanisms:**
   - Integrate Cybersecurity Service Provider (CSSP) tools.
   - Schedule periodic external penetration tests.

8. **Verify Secure Software Supply Chain:**
   - Generate and maintain Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
   - Use DevSecOps platforms that comply with approved reference designs.

9. **Conduct Regular Security Testing:**
   - Automate SAST, DAST, and IAST in the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Document and address security test findings.

10. **Logging and Auditing:**
    - Implement audit log collection and review processes.
    - Ensure logs are analyzed for abnormal activities.

11. **Team Training and Role Assignment:**
    - Train team members on DevSecOps and security practices.
    - Ensure roles are documented and least privilege principle is followed.

12. **Prepare System Authorization Package:**
    - Gather all required documentation: SSP, SAP, SAR, RAR, ATO memo, POA&Ms.

13. **Design Onboarding and Offboarding Processes:**
    - Document steps for bringing new team members on board and removing departing members.
    - Ensure processes are followed uniformly.

14. **Monitor and Adjust:**
    - Regularly review dashboard and monitoring outputs.
    - Adjust processes as needed based on security findings and evolving cATO requirements.

By tracking these actions, project managers can help ensure that a web application project aligns with cATO evaluation criteria and maintains compliance with government standards.
