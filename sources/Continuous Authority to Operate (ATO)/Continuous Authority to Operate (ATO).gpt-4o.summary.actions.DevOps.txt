For a DevOps technician who must design and manage infrastructure to support a web application, here is a minimal list of actions necessary to show compliance with the cATO standards:

1. **Implement Continuous Monitoring:**
   - **Automate Vulnerability Scanning:**
     - Use tools to scan for vulnerabilities continuously.
   - **Dashboard Setup:**
     - Establish and maintain a monitoring dashboard that provides real-time system status.
   - **Log Management:**
     - Centralize and automate the collection, analysis, and alerting of audit logs.

2. **Set Up Active Cyber Defense:**
   - **Penetration Testing:**
     - Schedule and document regular penetration tests.
   - **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:**
     - Deploy and configure IDS/IPS tools to monitor for suspicious activities.
   - **CSSP Coordination:**
     - Ensure integration with certified Cybersecurity Service Providers and their continuous monitoring tools.

3. **Secure Software Supply Chain and DevSecOps Practices:**
   - **Use DevSecOps Platform:**
     - Rely on a DevSecOps platform that follows a DoD-approved reference design.
   - **Implement CI/CD Pipeline:**
     - Automate build, test, and deployment processes using reliable CI/CD tools.
   - **Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**
     - Regularly produce and update SBOMs for all application components.

4. **Establish Control Gates and Guardrails:**
   - **Define Automated Control Gates:**
     - Implement control gates that enforce security policies during CI/CD workflows.
   - **Set Risk-based Guardrails:**
     - Configure automated triggers for compliance and risk management alerts.

5. **Integrate Cloud Security:**
   - **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):**
     - Implement CSPM for continuous monitoring and addressing of cloud misconfigurations.
   - **Artifact Scanning:**
     - Automate scans for vulnerabilities and compliance in artifacts and container images.

6. **Configuration and Infrastructure Management:**
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
     - Use IaC tools (e.g., Terraform) for consistent infrastructure provisioning.
   - **Configuration Management:**
     - Implement Configuration as Code (CaC) to avoid environment drifts.

7. **Incident Response Readiness:**
   - **Incident Response Plan:**
     - Maintain and regularly update an incident response plan.
   - **Automation for Alerts:**
     - Configure automated alerts for suspicious activities and incidents.

8. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - **Maintain Compliance Documentation:**
     - Ensure continuous documentation of security measures and compliance status.
   - **Regular Updates to System Security Plan (SSP):**
     - Periodically review and update the SSP based on findings from continuous monitoring.

By following these actions, a DevOps technician can ensure the web application infrastructure is compliant with the standards laid out in the Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) framework.
