### Summary of Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

1. **Continuous Monitoring (CONMON)**
   - Implement robust continuous monitoring strategies for security.
   - Regularly assess and track system vulnerabilities.
   - Provide automated metrics and alerts.

2. **Active Cyber Defense (ACD)**
   - Maintain certified Cybersecurity Service Provider (CSSP) support.
   - Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments by third parties.
   - Test security in real-time; monitor and mitigate threats continuously.

3. **Secure Software Supply Chain (SSSC) and DevSecOps**
   - Use an authorized DevSecOps Platform (DSOP).
   - Maintain and analyze Software Bills of Materials (SBOM).
   - Follow DevSecOps activities and tools mapping.
   - Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration as Code (CaC).
   
4. **Authorization to Operate (ATO) Requirements**
   - Ensure system has a valid ATO with no high/very high unmitigated findings.
   - Regularly update and maintain security documentation.

### Key Areas Focusing on Security, Accessibility, User Experience, and Compliance

1. **Security:**
   - Continuous monitoring of security controls.
   - Active cyber defense with real-time threat detection.
   - Automated security testing in DevSecOps processes.

2. **Accessibility:**
   - Not explicitly mentioned.
   - Ensure system complies with general accessibility standards where applicable.

3. **User Experience:**
   - Ensure automated processes are user-friendly and effective.
   - Provide real-time dashboards for monitoring.

4. **Compliance:**
   - Follow DoD and NIST guidelines (NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-161r1).
   - Maintain robust incident response and continuous monitoring strategies.
   - Keep ATO documentation up-to-date and aligned with RMF guidelines.
