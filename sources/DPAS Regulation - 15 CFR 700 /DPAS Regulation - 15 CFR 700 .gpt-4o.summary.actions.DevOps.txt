Certainly! For a DevOps technician focused on designing and managing infrastructure to support a web application, compliance with government standards typically involves the following minimal list of actions:

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Ensure end-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit using HTTPS/TLS protocols.

2. **Access Controls**:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
   - Enforce role-based access controls (RBAC) for system resources.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Set up comprehensive logging for all system activities.
   - Monitor system health and access logs continuously for suspicious activities.

4. **Patch Management**:
   - Regularly apply security patches and updates to all software and infrastructure components.

5. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Implement automated, regular data backups.
   - Test backup and disaster recovery procedures periodically to ensure reliability.

6. **Network Security**:
   - Utilize firewalls and VPNs to protect network boundaries.
   - Segment the network to isolate sensitive data and critical services.

7. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Ensure systems are auditable and maintain records of compliance-related activities.
   - Regularly review and update compliance evidence to stay current with standards.

8. **Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing**:
   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and address identified issues promptly.
   - Perform periodic penetration testing to discover and mitigate weaknesses.

9. **Incident Response Plan**:
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan and ensure team members are trained on it.

10. **Configuration Management**:
    - Use configuration management tools to maintain consistent and secure infrastructure configurations.

By ensuring these actions are in place, a DevOps technician can help ensure the web application infrastructure complies with relevant government standards.
