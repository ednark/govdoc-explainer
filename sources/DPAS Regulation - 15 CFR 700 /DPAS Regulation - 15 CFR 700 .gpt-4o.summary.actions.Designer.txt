For a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design responsible for User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) of a government-contracted web application, the minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with Government Standards should include:

1. **Accessible Design:** Ensure adherence to Section 508 standards for accessibility to accommodate users with disabilities.
2. **Usability Testing:** Conduct regular usability testing with diverse user groups to ensure the application is intuitive and easy to navigate.
3. **Responsive Design:** Implement responsive design principles to ensure the application is functional and aesthetically pleasing on various devices and screen sizes.
4. **Consistent Branding:** Align with government branding guidelines, including appropriate use of logos, colors, and typography.
5. **Language and Readability:** Apply plain language principles to make sure content is clear and understandable by the general public.
6. **Feedback Mechanism:** Include mechanisms for users to provide feedback on their experience, ensuring continuous improvement.
7. **Data Privacy and Security:** Incorporate security best practices in UI design to protect user data in alignment with governmental privacy standards.
8. **User-Centric Workflow:** Design user workflows that are logical and minimize friction, focusing on the end-userâ€™s goals and needs.
9. **Documentation:** Maintain thorough documentation of the design process and decisions to provide a clear rationale for compliance.

These actions ensure that the web application not only meets but also aligns with the governmental standards for providing a user-focused, accessible, and secure digital service.
