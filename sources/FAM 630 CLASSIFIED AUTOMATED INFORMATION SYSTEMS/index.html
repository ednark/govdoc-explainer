Appointment of an
Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO)
(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)
a. For each Department AIS, an ISSO must be designated,
in writing, to manage the AIS security program. An alternate ISSO must also be
designated, in writing, to fulfill these duties in the absence of the ISSO. These requirements apply regardless of the size of the AIS. For non
-
mainframe AISs, these designations will be made
by the executive director for each bureau or office for a domestic AIS, and by
the administrative officer for an AIS abroad. For mainframe AISs, these
designations will be made by the data center manager in consultation with the
mainframe security program manager. For
Regional
Information Management Center (
RIMC
)
AISs,
these designations will be made by the RIMC director. 12 FAH-10 H-352.1
contains a
sample memorandum assigning ISSO responsibilities to an individual. b. On non
-
mainframe
AISs, the ISSO and alternate ISSO do not have to be system managers. On
mainframe AISs, the duties of the ISSO and alternate ISSO must be separate from
those of the data center manager. c.  On non
-
mainframe
AISs, the ISSO and the alternate ISSO will have full access to the AIS. On
mainframe AISs, the ISSO and alternate ISSO will be given access to only those
system functions that are required for them to perform their official duties.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Additionally, on mainframe AISs where the central components of a classified
distributed AIS are located within the
Information
Programs Center
(IPC), the ISSO and alternate ISSO must also have crypto
clearances for use. d. In compliance with the Department's Internal
Controls Program, the ISSO's performance appraisal will be based in part on
effective implementation of AIS security requirements. See
12 FAM 637
for additional information. e. For mainframe AISs, a copy of the signed memorandums
designating the mainframe application ISSO and the alternate mainframe
application ISSO must be submitted to the Systems Integrity Division of the
Information Technology Infrastructure Office (IRM/FO/ITI/SI). f.  IRM/FO/ITI/SI shall designate, in writing, a
Mainframe Security Program manager who will implement and manage the Department’s
AIS security program for mainframe AISs. The Mainframe Security Program
manager will advise all mainframe application ISSOs on the Department’s
mainframe AIS security policies and procedures so that no one mainframe AIS
will compromise the security of another. He or she will also facilitate the
exchange of information among mainframe ISSOs and will assist them in solving
technical or procedural problems. IRM/FO/ITI/SI shall designate, in writing,
an alternate Mainframe Security Program manager to fulfill those
responsibilities when the primary Mainframe Security Program manager is absent. 12 FAM 632.1-3
Controlling Access
to Systems
(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)
a. The ISSO, on mainframe AISs, and the system manager,
on non
-
mainframe AISs, must control and
limit AIS access to the level necessary for users to perform their official
duties.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> b. Supervisors must complete a system access request
for each authorized user. c.  Personnel officers must include the data center
manager and the system manager on the bureau or post checkout list to ensure
timely notification of all employees and contractors who are transferred or
terminated. The data center manager and the system manager, in conjunction
with the ISSO, must revoke user access privileges for these personnel. Personnel officers must notify the data center manager, system manager, RSO,
and ISSO promptly of any employee or contractor with system access who is
terminated for cause. Revocation of user access privileges is immediate. d. The ISSOs on non
-
mainframe
AISs will annually review all AIS users with exceptional access privileges. The ISSOs on mainframe AISs will review at least quarterly all AIS users with
exceptional access privileges. The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that
the users require such privileges to perform their official duties. e. The program manager must annually review the access
privileges for each AIS mainframe user with access to an application
system/database under the user’s supervision to ensure that the user
requires the access to perform his or her official duties.</div><div id="chunk-6" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The program manager
must report the findings of the review to the appropriate ISSO. f.  When other application systems or other independent
processes access a mainframe AIS application system/database, the program
manager responsible for the application system/database must annually review
these accesses to ensure that the other application system or independent
process still requires access to perform its function. The program manager
must report the findings of the review to the appropriate ISSO. g. The ISSO, on mainframe AISs, must ensure that
contractor personnel with mainframe AIS access retain this access for only a
specified period of time, not to exceed 3 years. At the end of the specified
time period, contractor personnel must make a formal request to the ISSO for
renewal of their AIS access. h. The system administrator must ensure that accounts
are temporarily disabled after 90 days of inactivity. Before reactivating the
account, the user’s supervisor must recertify in writing, e.g., via email
or memo that the user still requires the account. i. The chief information officer has authority to
review and de-activate user accounts that are not compliant with security
standards or policies as promulgated through FAM security regulations, Security
Configuration Guides, and any other enterprise-wide requirements mandated via
an ALDAC or Department Notice. 12 FAM 632.1-4
User
Identification and Authentication Controls
(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)
a. System managers must configure systems to require
user identification and authentication.</div><div id="chunk-7" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> b. System managers must configure networked systems to
require a Smart Card and passphrase for user authentication. This includes
networked devices, e.g., multi-function printers and digital senders that
require user authentication. Send requests for exceptions to the Smart Card
requirement to IRM/
IA
. c.  System managers must configure standalone systems
to require either:
(1) Both a Smart Card and passphrase; or
(2) A password for user authentication. d. Personnel with elevated system privileges must have
separate privileged and user accounts, and the privileged account must not be
used to perform user activities, e.g., sending email or accessing external web
sites/applications. e. System managers must immediately delete user IDs
under the following conditions:
(1)  Whenever notified by a user's supervisor that the
user no longer requires AIS access (e.g., user no longer employed with the
Department);
(2)  Whenever notified by a proper authority, such as
the human resources officer, that the user's employment has been terminated
with the Department; or
(3)  When the user ID is no longer needed (e.g.,
obsolete account). 12 FAM 632.1-4(A)
Smart Card
and Passphrase Controls
(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)
a. Smart Cards and IDs issued by system managers to
users must be unique; group user IDs and/or shared passwords are prohibited. Requests for exceptions should be sent to
the
Directorate for Cyber and Technology Security (
DS/CTS
)
and IRM/CO for a recommendation and decision,
respectively, regarding whether or not to grant the request.</div><div id="chunk-8" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> b. Users must create a unique passphrase for each
account, in accordance with these specifications:
(1)  Passphrase length:  The passphrase must have a
minimum length of eight characters;
(2)  Passphrase composition:  The user must compose the
passphrase with characters from at least three of the following four groups
from the standard keyboard:
(a)  Upper case letters (A-Z);
(b)  Lower case letters (a-z);
(c)  Arabic numerals (0 through 9); and
(d)  Non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation symbols). c.  Passphrases will be valid for the life of the
certificate on the Smart Card, i.e., three years. d. System managers must not keep permanent user IDs and
Smart Cards for visitors, training, demonstrations, or other purposes. If
necessary, issue a temporary user ID and password not to exceed three days, and
immediately delete the temporary user account when no longer needed, i.e., in
three days or less. e. The system manager must configure systems to lock
the Smart Card after 10 failed login attempts. f.  Passphrases are classified at the highest level of
classified information for which the system is authorized
,
and must not be used to provide access on
different classification level systems. Users must protect written passphrases
for classified systems as follows:
(1)  Store written passphrases in Department-approved
classified containers in accordance with
12 FAM 530
;
(2)  Place written passphrases in a sealed envelope
with the proper classification marking (e.g., SECRET) if stored in a shared
container; and
(3)  Do not store written passphrases on an automated
information system, on removable media, or on an audio recording device. g. The National Security System (NSS) SECRET-high
network PKI token (i.e., Smart Card) is classified Secret when unlocked and in
use. If the Smart Card is left unlocked, logged onto the system, and
unattended after normal business hours, this may be considered a security
violation (see
12 FAM 550
).</div><div id="chunk-9" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The
Smart Card/PKI token is considered UNCLASSIFIED when removed from its reader
and not in use and shall be maintained like a Department identification badge. See
12 FAM 371.5
. h. Users must report known or suspected lost, stolen,
and/or compromised Smart Cards to their Local Registration Authority (LRA),
ISSO, and if overseas, RSO. The LRA must report the incident to the PKI
Registration Center to revoke the certificate on the card and enable the user
to receive a new Smart Card and passphrase. i. Users who forget their Smart Card (e.g., leave it
at home) must contact their LRA to arrange for a temporary, one-day password. j. Users assigned temporary duty overseas may put in a
request to the IT Service Center prior to departure to have the requirement for
them to use a Smart Card for ClassNet access lifted during the TDY dates. k. Users must surrender revoked or expired smart cards
to the system manager who will return them to the PKI office for re-use or
destruction. l.  Users must acknowledge receipt of their Smart Card
by signing a Smart Card receipt/security acknowledgement.</div><div id="chunk-10" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> See
12 FAM 632.1-4(B)
for a sample format that managers can modify
for use with Smart Cards. Users must acknowledge separately receipt of the PKI
certificates housed on their Smart Card by signing the “APPLICATION FOR
CLASSNET PKI TOKEN REQUEST/RECEIPT FORM.”
12 FAM 632.1-4(B)
Password
Controls
(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)
a. System managers must initially assign each new user
a unique user ID and a minimum 12 character, alphanumeric, randomly generated
password. System managers must not assign group user IDs and passwords. The
system must force the user to immediately change this issued password when the
new user accesses the system for the first time. A newly created password must
comply with the following specifications:
(1)  Password length:  The password must have a minimum
length of 12 characters;
and
(2)  Password composition:  Users must compose the
password with at least
one character from each
of
the following groups:
·
Upper case letters (A-Z);
·
Lower case letters (a-z);
·
Arabic numerals (0 through 9). b. System managers may issue machine-generated
passwords to users for AISs that cannot be configured to filter user-created
passwords. c.  System managers must construct and issue passwords
to network devices (e.g., switches or routers) as stated in paragraph a of this
section or as in paragraph b of this section when password construction cannot
comply with requirements in paragraph a of this section. This applies to all
network devices regardless of the transport mechanism (e.g., Internet Protocol
(IP), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), etc.).</div><div id="chunk-11" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> d. System managers must not keep permanent user IDs and
passwords on AISs for visitors, training, demonstrations, or other purposes. e. System managers must act in a manner that prevents
unauthorized disclosure when distributing passwords to users and must advise
users of the password's classification. Password classification must equal the
highest level of the system’s classification level, and passwords must
not be used to provide access on different classification level systems. Users
must inform the ISSO if they suspect or know of a compromise of their
passwords. f.   Users must sign receipts/security acknowledgements
to acknowledge receipt of their user IDs and passwords. See
12 FAM 632.1-4(B)
for a sample
format. g. System managers must ensure that users change their
passwords under the following conditions:
(1)
Immediately
following any suspected or actual compromise; or
(2)
Whenever
someone with system security authority no longer requires that level of access. h
. System managers
must ensure the following are the minimum required settings:
(1)
Set the
minimum password age to one day; and
(2)
Set the
password history feature to retain the last 24 password generations for each
individual user. i
.</div><div id="chunk-12" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Users must
create a unique password for each user account. j
. Users must
protect written passwords for classified systems as follows:
(1)  Store written passwords in Department-approved
classified containers in accordance with
12 FAM 530
;
(2)  Place written passwords in a sealed envelope with
the proper classification marking (e.g., SECRET when stored in a shared
container); and
(3)  Do not store written passwords on an automated
information system, on removable media, or on an audio recording device. 12 FAM 632.1-5
Use of Systems
(CT:DS-287;   01-30-2018)
a. The ISSO must notify all AIS users that personal use
of the Department's classified AIS equipment is strictly prohibited; therefore,
users do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the AIS. The
director, Diplomatic Security Service, may authorize access to special agents
of the Department of State and other Federal law enforcement agencies in the
conduct of investigations concerning employee misconduct or the violation of
any Federal law. See
12 FAM 637
for additional information. b. The ISSO must instruct all AIS users that classified
workstations are never to be left unattended when logged on. All activity
occurring when the workstation is functioning is the responsibility of the
logged-on user.</div><div id="chunk-13" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> See
12 FAM 637

                        <div class="accordion-content"><p>For a web application, specifically for a developer specializing in implementing Drupal, here is a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with the government standards document:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Secure Access Controls</strong>: Implement user roles and permissions to ensure users have only the access necessary for their responsibilities (12 FAM 631.3-2).</li>
<li><strong>User Authentication</strong>: Configure systems to require user identification and authentication using Smart Cards and passphrases (12 FAM 632.1-4).</li>
<li><strong>Password Policies</strong>: Ensure passwords meet complexity requirements and are changed according to the specified schedule (12 FAM 632.1-4(B)).</li>
<li><strong>Secure Data Storage</strong>: Use proper methods for labeling and storing backup media according to classification levels (12 FAM 632.3-1).</li>
<li><strong>Auditing and Logging</strong>: Generate and review audit logs monthly for security-related incidents (12 FAM 632.1-11).</li>
<li><strong>Media Protection</strong>: Instruct users to handle all hard copy output and media according to security classification guidelines (12 FAM 632.1-6).</li>
<li><strong>Incident Reporting</strong>: Document and report any abnormal system operations or security incidents immediately (12 FAM 632.1-7).</li>
<li><strong>System Separation</strong>: Ensure there is no interconnectivity between classified and unclassified systems (12 FAM 634.1).</li>
<li><strong>Physical Security</strong>: Verify that all system components are secure and located within controlled access areas (12 FAM 634.1).</li>
<li><strong>Data Transfers</strong>: Follow strict procedures for transferring data between classified and unclassified systems (12 FAM 635.2).</li>
<li><strong>Regular Backups</strong>: Implement and document a full backup procedure for system programs and data (12 FAM 632.3-1).</li>
</ol>

<p>These actions should help to ensure the backend business logic aligns with the security and operational standards required for classified information systems.</p>
