(Office of Origin:  DS/CTS)</p>

<p class=FAMHeading18><a name=M631>12 FAM 631 </a> GENERAL</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-208;   04-09-2014)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText>The policies and procedures that appear in this subchapter
apply to all of the Department&#8217;s classified collateral automated
information systems (AISs), both domestic and abroad.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading16><a name="M631_1">12 FAM 631.1 </a> Personnel Security</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-160;   01-07-2011)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The Department establishes personnel security
procedures which require that all employees accessing any of the Department's
classified automated information system (AIS) processing resources have the
following:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  A Secret security clearance at a minimum;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  The appropriate access levels and need to know in
connection with the performance of official duties; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  Knowledge of their AIS security responsibilities.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Policies and procedures that appear in this section
implement the personnel security program for all of the Department's classified
AISs, both domestic and abroad.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading16><a name="M631_2">12 FAM 631.2 </a> Security Clearances</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M631_2_1">12 FAM 631.2-1 </a> Domestic</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The data center manager, the system manager, and the
<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>information systems security officer (</span>ISSO<span
class=FAMNewRevisedText>) </span>must ensure that all personnel with system
administrator privileges to an AIS processing classified information and
connected to a communications system have a Top Secret security clearance.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. The data center manager, the system manager, and the
ISSO must ensure that all personnel with access to classified AISs have a
Secret security clearance at a minimum.  Secret-cleared personnel may access an
AIS connected to an AIS/communications system processing Top Secret information
provided the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS)-approved hardware and software
control mechanisms prevent such personnel from accessing Top Secret
information.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M631_2_2">12 FAM 631.2-2 </a> Abroad</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(TL:DS-69;   06-22-2000)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The regional security officer (RSO) or post security
officer (PSO) must ensure that all personnel with system administrative access
to an AIS processing classified information and connected to a communications
processor have a Top Secret security clearance.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. The RSO must ensure that all personnel with access
to classified AISs have a Secret security clearance at a minimum.  Secret
cleared personnel may access an AIS connected to an AIS/ communications system
processing Top Secret information provided DS-approved hardware and software
control mechanisms prevent such personnel from accessing Top Secret
information.</p>

Responsibilities Statement</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-160;   01-07-2011)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText>Supervisors must include a statement specifying
responsibilities for AIS security in job and work requirements statements for
computer operations staff and program managers who have responsibility for
specific applications.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M631_3_2">12 FAM 631.3-2 </a> Separation of
Duties</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(TL:DS-83;   10-07-2002)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The data center manager, the system manager, and the
user's supervisor must configure user access privileges to ensure that users
receive access only to the information and system functionality required to
perform their official duties.  Access privileges must be consistent with the
separation of duties for handling classified information established in <a
href="https://usdos.sharepoint.com/sites/a-gis/dir/fam/Pages/12fam/12fam.aspx">12
FAM 500</a> for manual processes.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Supervisors must annually review access privileges
of each application user under their supervision to verify that the privileges
originally granted are still appropriate.  The data center manager and the
system manager will provide supervisors with any information necessary to aid
in the review and retain written documentation of directed changes.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  See <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M637">12 FAM
637</a> for additional information.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading18><a name=M632>12 FAM 632 </a> ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY</p>

<p class=FAMHeading16><a name="M632_1">12 FAM 632.1 </a> Management Control

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M632_1_1">12 FAM 632.1-1 </a> TEMPEST</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(TL:DS-69;   06-22-2000)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. All facilities processing information in the highest
threat environments <span class=FAMNewRevisedText>must </span>employ TEMPEST
countermeasures in proportion to the risk of exploitation and the associated
potential damage to the conduct of foreign relations and national security. 
Abroad, each mission must state who is responsible for maintaining TEMPEST
security (e.g., RSO, IMO, ISSO, etc.).</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Approval for the use of non-TEMPEST equipment must
be requested from the Department&#8217;s Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority
(CTTA).</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  The data center manager and the system manager must
ensure that TEMPEST AIS components are not inadvertently interchanged with
components from non-TEMPEST AISs.  Only with CTTA approval is the connection of
TEMPEST and non-TEMPEST equipment permitted.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M632_1_2">12 FAM 632.1-2 </a> Appointment of an
Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO)</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. For each Department AIS, an ISSO must be designated,
in writing, to manage the AIS security program.  An alternate ISSO must also be
designated, in writing, to fulfill these duties in the absence of the ISSO. 
These requirements apply regardless of the size of the AIS.  For non<span
class=FAMNewRevisedText>-</span>mainframe AISs, these designations will be made
by the executive director for each bureau or office for a domestic AIS, and by
the administrative officer for an AIS abroad.  For mainframe AISs, these
designations will be made by the data center manager in consultation with the
mainframe security program manager.  For <span class=FAMNewRevisedText>Regional
Information Management Center (</span>RIMC<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>) </span>AISs,
these designations will be made by the RIMC director.  <a
href="/fam/12fah10/12fah100350.html#H352_1">12 FAH-10 H-352.1</a> contains a
sample memorandum assigning ISSO responsibilities to an individual.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. On non<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>-</span>mainframe
AISs, the ISSO and alternate ISSO do not have to be system managers.  On
mainframe AISs, the duties of the ISSO and alternate ISSO must be separate from
those of the data center manager.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  On non<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>-</span>mainframe
AISs, the ISSO and the alternate ISSO will have full access to the AIS.  On
mainframe AISs, the ISSO and alternate ISSO will be given access to only those
system functions that are required for them to perform their official duties. 
Additionally, on mainframe AISs where the central components of a classified
distributed AIS are located within the <span class=FAMNewRevisedText>Information
Programs Center </span>(IPC), the ISSO and alternate ISSO must also have crypto
clearances for use.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. In compliance with the Department's Internal
Controls Program, the ISSO's performance appraisal will be based in part on
effective implementation of AIS security requirements.  See <a
href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M637">12 FAM 637</a><span
class=FAMNewRevisedText> </span>for additional information.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. For mainframe AISs, a copy of the signed memorandums
designating the mainframe application ISSO and the alternate mainframe
application ISSO must be submitted to the Systems Integrity Division of the
Information Technology Infrastructure Office (IRM/FO/ITI/SI).</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  IRM/FO/ITI/SI shall designate, in writing, a
Mainframe Security Program manager who will implement and manage the Department&#8217;s
AIS security program for mainframe AISs.  The Mainframe Security Program
manager will advise all mainframe application ISSOs on the Department&#8217;s
mainframe AIS security policies and procedures so that no one mainframe AIS
will compromise the security of another.  He or she will also facilitate the
exchange of information among mainframe ISSOs and will assist them in solving
technical or procedural problems.  IRM/FO/ITI/SI shall designate, in writing,
an alternate Mainframe Security Program manager to fulfill those
responsibilities when the primary Mainframe Security Program manager is absent.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M632_1_3">12 FAM 632.1-3 </a> Controlling Access
to Systems</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The ISSO, on mainframe AISs, and the system manager,
on non<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>-</span>mainframe AISs, must control and
limit AIS access to the level necessary for users to perform their official
duties.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Supervisors must complete a system access request
for each authorized user.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  Personnel officers must include the data center
manager and the system manager on the bureau or post checkout list to ensure
timely notification of all employees and contractors who are transferred or
terminated.  The data center manager and the system manager, in conjunction
with the ISSO, must revoke user access privileges for these personnel. 
Personnel officers must notify the data center manager, system manager, RSO,
and ISSO promptly of any employee or contractor with system access who is
terminated for cause.  Revocation of user access privileges is immediate.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. The ISSOs on non<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>-</span>mainframe
AISs will annually review all AIS users with exceptional access privileges. 
The ISSOs on mainframe AISs will review at least quarterly all AIS users with
exceptional access privileges.  The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that
the users require such privileges to perform their official duties.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. The program manager must annually review the access
privileges for each AIS mainframe user with access to an application
system/database under the user&#8217;s supervision to ensure that the user
requires the access to perform his or her official duties.  The program manager
must report the findings of the review to the appropriate ISSO.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  When other application systems or other independent
processes access a mainframe AIS application system/database, the program
manager responsible for the application system/database must annually review
these accesses to ensure that the other application system or independent
process still requires access to perform its function.  The program manager
must report the findings of the review to the appropriate ISSO.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>g. The ISSO, on mainframe AISs, must ensure that
contractor personnel with mainframe AIS access retain this access for only a
specified period of time, not to exceed 3 years.  At the end of the specified
time period, contractor personnel must make a formal request to the ISSO for
renewal of their AIS access.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>h. The system administrator must ensure that accounts
are temporarily disabled after 90 days of inactivity.  Before reactivating the
account, the user&#8217;s supervisor must recertify in writing, e.g., via email
or memo that the user still requires the account.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>i.  The chief information officer has authority to
review and de-activate user accounts that are not compliant with security
standards or policies as promulgated through FAM security regulations, Security
Configuration Guides, and any other enterprise-wide requirements mandated via
an ALDAC or Department Notice.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M632_1_4">12 FAM 632.1-4 </a> User
Identification and Authentication Controls</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. System managers must configure systems to require
user identification and authentication.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. System managers must configure networked systems to
require a Smart Card and passphrase for user authentication.  This includes
networked devices, e.g., multi-function printers and digital senders that
require user authentication.  Send requests for exceptions to the Smart Card
requirement to IRM/<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>IA</span>.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  System managers must configure standalone systems
to require either:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1) Both a Smart Card and passphrase; or</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2) A password for user authentication.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. Personnel with elevated system privileges must have
separate privileged and user accounts, and the privileged account must not be
used to perform user activities, e.g., sending email or accessing external web
sites/applications.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. System managers must immediately delete user IDs
under the following conditions:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Whenever notified by a user's supervisor that the
user no longer requires AIS access (e.g., user no longer employed with the
Department);</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  Whenever notified by a proper authority, such as
the human resources officer, that the user's employment has been terminated
with the Department; or</p>

and Passphrase Controls</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Smart Cards and IDs issued by system managers to
users must be unique; group user IDs and/or shared passwords are prohibited. 
Requests for exceptions should be sent to <span class=FAMNewRevisedText>the
Directorate for Cyber and Technology Security (</span>DS/CTS<span
class=FAMNewRevisedText>) </span>and IRM/CO for a recommendation and decision,
respectively, regarding whether or not to grant the request.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Users must create a unique passphrase for each
account, in accordance with these specifications:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Passphrase length:  The passphrase must have a
minimum length of eight characters;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  Passphrase composition:  The user must compose the
passphrase with characters from at least three of the following four groups
from the standard keyboard:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTexta>(a)  Upper case letters (A-Z);</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTexta>(b)  Lower case letters (a-z);</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTexta>(c)  Arabic numerals (0 through 9); and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTexta>(d)  Non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation symbols).</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  Passphrases will be valid for the life of the
certificate on the Smart Card, i.e., three years.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. System managers must not keep permanent user IDs and
Smart Cards for visitors, training, demonstrations, or other purposes.  If
necessary, issue a temporary user ID and password not to exceed three days, and
immediately delete the temporary user account when no longer needed, i.e., in
three days or less.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. The system manager must configure systems to lock
the Smart Card after 10 failed login attempts.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  Passphrases are classified at the highest level of
classified information for which the system is authorized<span
class=FAMNewRevisedText>, </span>and must not be used to provide access on
different classification level systems.  Users must protect written passphrases
for classified systems as follows:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Store written passphrases in Department-approved
classified containers in accordance with <a
href="/fam/12fam/12fam0530.html#M530">12 FAM 530</a>;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  Place written passphrases in a sealed envelope
with the proper classification marking (e.g., SECRET) if stored in a shared
container; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  Do not store written passphrases on an automated
information system, on removable media, or on an audio recording device.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>g. The National Security System (NSS) SECRET-high
network PKI token (i.e., Smart Card) is classified Secret when unlocked and in
use.  If the Smart Card is left unlocked, logged onto the system, and
unattended after normal business hours, this may be considered a security
violation (see <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0550.html#M550">12 FAM 550</a>).  The
Smart Card/PKI token is considered UNCLASSIFIED when removed from its reader
and not in use and shall be maintained like a Department identification badge. 
See <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0370.html#M371_5">12 FAM 371.5</a>.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>h. Users must report known or suspected lost, stolen,
and/or compromised Smart Cards to their Local Registration Authority (LRA),
ISSO, and if overseas, RSO.  The LRA must report the incident to the PKI
Registration Center to revoke the certificate on the card and enable the user
to receive a new Smart Card and passphrase.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>i.  Users who forget their Smart Card (e.g., leave it
at home) must contact their LRA to arrange for a temporary, one-day password.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>j.  Users assigned temporary duty overseas may put in a
request to the IT Service Center prior to departure to have the requirement for
them to use a Smart Card for ClassNet access lifted during the TDY dates.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>k. Users must surrender revoked or expired smart cards
to the system manager who will return them to the PKI office for re-use or
destruction.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>l.  Users must acknowledge receipt of their Smart Card
by signing a Smart Card receipt/security acknowledgement.  See <a
href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M632_1_4_B">12 FAM 632.1-4(B)</a><span
class=FAMNewRevisedText> </span>for a sample format that managers can modify
for use with Smart Cards.  Users must acknowledge separately receipt of the PKI
certificates housed on their Smart Card by signing the &#8220;APPLICATION FOR
CLASSNET PKI TOKEN REQUEST/RECEIPT FORM.&#8221;</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M632_1_4_B">12 FAM 632.1-4(B) </a> Password
Controls</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. System managers must initially assign each new user
a unique user ID and a minimum 12 character, alphanumeric, randomly generated
password.  System managers must not assign group user IDs and passwords.  The
system must force the user to immediately change this issued password when the
new user accesses the system for the first time.  A newly created password must
comply with the following specifications:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Password length:  The password must have a minimum
length of 12 characters; <span class=FAMNewRevisedText>and</span></p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  Password composition:  Users must compose the
password with at least <span class=FAMNewRevisedText>one character from each </span>of
the following groups:</p>

<p class=FAMBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Upper case letters (A-Z);</p>

<p class=FAMBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Lower case letters (a-z);</p>

<p class=FAMBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Arabic numerals (0 through 9).</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. System managers may issue machine-generated
passwords to users for AISs that cannot be configured to filter user-created
passwords.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  System managers must construct and issue passwords
to network devices (e.g., switches or routers) as stated in paragraph a of this
section or as in paragraph b of this section when password construction cannot
comply with requirements in paragraph a of this section.  This applies to all
network devices regardless of the transport mechanism (e.g., Internet Protocol
(IP), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), etc.).</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. System managers must not keep permanent user IDs and
passwords on AISs for visitors, training, demonstrations, or other purposes.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. System managers must act in a manner that prevents
unauthorized disclosure when distributing passwords to users and must advise
users of the password's classification.  Password classification must equal the
highest level of the system&#8217;s classification level, and passwords must
not be used to provide access on different classification level systems.  Users
must inform the ISSO if they suspect or know of a compromise of their
passwords.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.   Users must sign receipts/security acknowledgements
to acknowledge receipt of their user IDs and passwords.  See <a
href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M632_1_4_B">12 FAM 632.1-4(B)</a> for a sample
format.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>g. System managers must ensure that users change their
passwords under the following conditions:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123><span class=FAMNewRevisedText>(1)</span>  Immediately
following any suspected or actual compromise; or</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123><span class=FAMNewRevisedText>(2)</span>  Whenever
someone with system security authority no longer requires that level of access.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc><span class=FAMNewRevisedText>h</span>. System managers
must ensure the following are the minimum required settings:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123><span class=FAMNewRevisedText>(1)</span>  Set the
minimum password age to one day; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123><span class=FAMNewRevisedText>(2)</span>  Set the
password history feature to retain the last 24 password generations for each
individual user.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc><span class=FAMNewRevisedText>i</span>.  Users must
create a unique password for each user account.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc><span class=FAMNewRevisedText>j</span>.  Users must
protect written passwords for classified systems as follows:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Store written passwords in Department-approved
classified containers in accordance with <a
href="/fam/12fam/12fam0530.html#M530">12 FAM 530</a>;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  Place written passwords in a sealed envelope with
the proper classification marking (e.g., SECRET when stored in a shared
container); and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  Do not store written passwords on an automated
information system, on removable media, or on an audio recording device.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M632_1_5">12 FAM 632.1-5 </a> Use of Systems</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-287;   01-30-2018)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The ISSO must notify all AIS users that personal use
of the Department's classified AIS equipment is strictly prohibited; therefore,
users do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the AIS.  The
director, Diplomatic Security Service, may authorize access to special agents
of the Department of State and other Federal law enforcement agencies in the
conduct of investigations concerning employee misconduct or the violation of
any Federal law.  See <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M637">12 FAM 637</a>
for additional information.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. The ISSO must instruct all AIS users that classified
workstations are never to be left unattended when logged on.  All activity
occurring when the workstation is functioning is the responsibility of the
logged-on user.  See <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M637">12 FAM 637</a>
for additional information.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  The ISSO, data center manager, or system manager
must ensure that DS-approved labels, indicating the highest level of
information processed by the AIS, are affixed to all classified AISs.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. Users must process NODIS and EXDIS information under
the most stringent access controls available on the AIS.  NODIS and EXDIS
information should remain on the AIS only a minimal amount of time.  Users must
inform the data center manager and the system manager when NODIS and EXDIS
information is placed on the AIS.  NODIS and EXDIS information should be purged
from the AIS as soon as it is no longer needed.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. Mainframe AIS users must also comply with
established mainframe operational procedures and guidance issued by
IRM/FO/ITI/SI.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M632_1_6">12 FAM 632.1-6 </a> Protection of

FAM 500</a> which defines requirements for marking, classifying and
declassifying, accountability, transportation, transmission, storage, and
destruction of national security information.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. The data center manager and the system manager must
limit access to the operating system and application software designated for
use on the classified AIS to U.S. citizen personnel who are cleared and
authorized access.  The data center manager and the system manager must store
all operating system and application software in an approved security
container.  See <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M637">12 FAM 637</a> for
additional information.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  Abroad, the RSO or PSO must review and approve all
locally established procedures for transportation and control of classified
media.  Media shipped between posts must be sent by classified pouch.  See <a
href="https://usdos.sharepoint.com/sites/a-gis/dir/fam/Pages/12fam/12fam.aspx">12
FAM 500</a> for domestic transportation requirements.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. AIS users must review all hard copy output prior to
relaxing the controls relating to processing classified information.  All
output must be handled as if classified at the highest classification processed
on the AIS.  Classification will remain unchanged until reviewed by an
individual cleared to the same level.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. AIS users must mark all removable magnetic media to
indicate the highest classification level of information authorized to be
processed on the AIS.  All media will be handled as required by the labels.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  Only media which has been shipped via classified
pouch and under the continuous control of cleared U.S. citizens may be loaded
onto an AIS-approved for classified processing.  See <a

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-409;   06-22-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. System managers shall implement and document a full
backup procedure for system programs and information to ensure continuity of
operations.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. System managers must place a network firecall
(emergency) Smart Card and passphrase with system administrator privileges in a
sealed envelope marked with the proper classification.  Domestically, system
managers must give the envelope to the bureau&#8217;s executive director, and,
abroad, to the post administrative officer, for availability under emergency
situations or exceptional conditions.  Domestically, the executive director,
and abroad, the administrative officer must ensure that this Smart Card and
passphrase is stored in a secure location.  If the executive director or post
administrative officer releases the Smart Card and passphrase, i.e., because of
an emergency, she or he must promptly notify the ISSO and IMO in writing.  The
recipient ISSO and IMO must immediately return the fire call Smart Card and
passphrase when they are no longer needed, in order for the Bureau&#8217;s
executive director or post&#8217;s administrative officer to put the Smart Card
and passphrase back in the secure location.  Implement identical firecall
procedures for non-network AISs that require a user ID and password for
emergency system manager access.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  AISs administered by U.S. Government agencies other
than the Department will comply with the backup and contingency planning
requirements of their agency.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. Standalone PC users must periodically back up their
data onto removable media to ensure continued operations if authorized to
download files by <span class=FAMNewRevisedText>IRM/CO </span>in accordance
with <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M635_2">12 FAM 635.2</a> paragraph f
requirements.  Otherwise, users must ensure that their data is periodically
backed up by the system manager.  Abroad users must store their backup data in
an approved security container within a controlled access area (CAA), or
domestically, within a facility authorized to store or process classified
information domestically.  The storage area must be as far away as possible
from the PC.  Distance minimizes the potential for complete loss of programs
and data should a major catastrophe occur.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. System managers or users, as appropriate, must
ensure that all backup media is appropriately labeled to indicate the highest
level of classified information processed on the AIS.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  System managers must store backup media for
distributed AISs in an approved security container.  Abroad the storage
location must be within the CAA, or domestically, within a facility authorized
to store or process classified information, but as far away as possible from
the main processing center.  Distance minimizes the potential for complete loss
of programs and data should a major catastrophe occur.  The system manager must
ensure that alternate storage locations are protected from adverse
environmental conditions, such as extreme heat, humidity, and air pollution.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M632_3_2">12 FAM 632.3-2 </a> Contingency Plan Preparation</p>

<p class=FAMHeading18><a name=M633>12 FAM 633 </a> SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(TL:DS-69;   06-22-2000)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText>Due to variations in hardware and software capabilities
between different AISs, post personnel must implement the controls described
below that are applicable to their specific AIS.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading16><a name="M633_1">12 FAM 633.1 </a> Operating System and
Application Software</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-287;   01-30-2018)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText>Citizens of countries for which the Office of Intelligence
and Threat Analysis (DS/TIA/ITA) has assessed a critical technical and/or human
intelligence threat level shall not develop, modify, or perform maintenance on
software used on Department of State computer systems, unless there has been
specific DS authorization for each incidence.  The information management
officer (IMO) responsible for State Department computer systems, both
domestically and abroad, must obtain DS/CTS authorization before such work is
begun.  See <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M637_3_4">12 FAM 637.3-4</a> for
procedures on obtaining such approval.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M633_1_1">12 FAM 633.1-1 </a> Operating System
Software</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-287;   01-30-2018)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Abroad, the data center manager and the system
manager ensure that all classified AISs use only the Department-approved and
distributed version of the vendor operating system.  IRM will distribute all
operating system software to post via classified pouch.  Domestically, the data
center manager and the system manager ensure that DS/CTS is notified prior to
installing operating system software that has never before been installed on
any Department multi-user AIS.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Only the data center manager and the system manager
may install new releases, upgrades, or patches to the vendor operating system. 
If abroad, these must be received from the Department.  Abroad, software sent
directly by a vendor or a vendor's authorized distributor will not be installed
on any post AIS without prior IRM approval.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  AIS users must not modify operating system
software.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. The data center manager and the system manager must
control access to all system software, utilities, and functionality that could
be used to gain unauthorized access to application data and program code.  The
data center manager and the system manager will restrict such access to the
minimum number of authorized users required to perform their official duties.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. On domestic mainframe AISs and on mainframe AISs
abroad, system staff members must not modify operating system software except
when installing or applying Department approved and distributed software
updates or fixes.  The data center manager must approve all such updates.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  On domestic mainframe AISs and on mainframe AISs
abroad, whenever operating system software is installed for which access
control is an optional or add-on component, the ISSO in conjunction with
IRM/FO/ITI/SI and the mainframe AIS staff must ensure that the access control
component or add-on program is installed simultaneously with the operating
system software.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>g. On domestic mainframe AISs and on mainframe AISs
abroad, system staff members must not install software products which introduce
supervisor calls (SVCs), appendages, authorized programs, interfaces for
logging on, facilities for submitting jobs for execution, or methods of
accessing or transferring data without first ensuring that the products
correctly interface with the system security software (e.g., ACF2) and will not
adversely affect the security posture of the AIS.  The ISSO must ensure that
IRM/FO/ITI/SI and DS/CTS are notified in writing in the event that these
requirements cannot be met with respect to any software program product
residing on the AIS.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>h. On domestic mainframe AISs and on mainframe AISs
abroad, the ISSO, in conjunction with IRM/FO/ITI/SI, must ensure that periodic
integrity checks are performed on the mainframe AIS so that:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  All vendor-supplied updates or fixes have been
reviewed and do not compromise the integrity of the AIS;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  All Department programs and routines have been
reviewed and do not compromise the integrity of the AIS; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  All new operating systems have been reviewed and
do not compromise the integrity of the AIS.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>i.  All findings should be reported to the data center
manager, IRM/FO/ITI/SI, and DS/CTS.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M633_1_2">12 FAM 633.1-2 </a> Application
Software</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-409;   06-22-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The data center manager and the system manager must
ensure that only Department-approved and distributed versions of application
software are used on classified AISs.  All Department application software must
be sent to posts via classified pouch.  Domestically, only data center managers
and system managers may load versions of software to be used on classified
AISs.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Department and contractor personnel, other than
authorized application developers, may not modify Department standard
application software.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  Domestically, Department personnel may develop
application software, provided that it is developed and documented in
accordance with applicable Department standards.  All internally-developed
application software provided to other offices must remain under Department
control during transport or be shipped by U.S. registered mail.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. Abroad, the data center manager and the system
manager must ensure that all new releases, upgrades, or patches to Department
application software installed on post AISs have been approved by and received
from the Department.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. The data center manager and the system manager must
ensure that users' access rights and privileges are consistent with functional
responsibilities and authorities.  Access must be based on need-to-know, least
privilege, and supervisory requirements.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  The data center manager and the system manager must
ensure that users do not download or install software on U.S. Government AISs.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>g. The data center manager and the system manager must
ensure that all application software is acquired in accordance with Federal
copyright laws and /or a licensing agreement.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>h. The executive director for each bureau or office
sponsoring a mainframe AIS application system or database must designate in
writing a program manager for each such application system or database.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>i.  For each Department-sponsored mainframe AIS
application system or database, a protection schema must be developed.  A
protection schema is an outline detailing the types of access users may have to
a database or application system, given the users&#8217; need-to-know (e.g.,
read, write, modify, delete, create, execute, and append).  This protection
schema must include guidelines for granting or denying particular types of
accesses to the application system/database and should be included as part of
an application system&#8217;s security plan.  The program manager must obtain
clearance on the protection schema from IRM/FO/ITI/SI before implementation of
the schema. The program manager is responsible for ensuring that the protection
schema is enforced by the ISSO.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>j.  Upon major or minor modifications to a
Department-sponsored mainframe AIS application system or database, the program
manager will review the protection schema that is in place for the application
system/database and make revisions where necessary.  The program manager must
obtain clearance from IRM/FO/ITI/SI on such revisions before implementation. 
The program manager is responsible for informing the ISSO of any revision to
the protection schema.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>k. The ISSO must implement access controls to the
mainframe AIS application or database according to the guidance and
instructions of the program manager.  In the absence of explicit instructions
governing any particular instance of requested access, the ISSO must obtain the
approval of the applicable program manager prior to granting access.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>l.  Applications residing on classified mainframe AISs,
including applications interacting with classified mainframe AISs from other
systems, must be certified secure by the Directorate of Cyber Operations
(IRM/CO) and IRM/FO/ITI/SI before they are released to the field.  This
certification will assure that these applications meet national standards for
applications security.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>m. Annually, DS will report to the Undersecretary for
Management the extent to which the Department&#8217;s classified mainframe AIS
applications, including applications interacting with classified mainframes
from other systems, have been certified secure.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>n. Passwords to applications that use the
Department-approved operating system authentication mechanism must be
constructed as stated in <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0630.html#M632_1_4">12 FAM

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Domestically, all AIS equipment used to process
classified information must be located within a facility authorized to store
and process classified information.  Abroad, all AIS components must be located
within a controlled access area (CAA).  Physical security policy and standards
in <a
href="https://usdos.sharepoint.com/sites/a-gis/dir/fam/Pages/12fam/12fam.aspx">12
FAM 500</a> must be implemented.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. When unattended, all areas housing classified AIS
equipment must be technically and physically secured with DS-approved locks and
alarms.  The following additional physical security requirements pertain to
classified AIS equipment abroad.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  Abroad, a classified AIS may only be installed
after a pre-installation survey has been conducted for any area which will
house classified AIS equipment.  The RSO, the security engineering officer
(SEO), or a representative from the engineering services center (ESC), and the
IPO or a member of the Regional Information Management enter (RIMC) normally
perform these surveys.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. For posts with 24-hour cleared U.S. citizen guards,
all areas housing classified AIS equipment must be equipped with intrusion
detection systems.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. For posts without 24-hour cleared U.S. citizen
guards, classified AIS equipment must be stored in a vault or secure room and a
supplemental entry verification system (SEVS) must be installed.  See 12 FAH-6,
OSPB Security Standards and Policy Handbook, for SEVS requirements.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  If a SEVS activates in a location where classified
processing is performed, post must notify DS/SI/IS and DS/C/ST, and await
further instruction prior to using any classified AIS equipment housed in the
affected area.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>g. The data center manager and the system manager must
ensure that all major components of a distributed classified AIS are located

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>g. A record of all file downloads to removable media
must be maintained and available to the ISSO.  The cleared U.S. citizen systems
manager must maintain a record of each file transfer that the cleared U.S.
citizen systems administrator staff performs.  In addition, a user who IRM/<span
class=FAMNewRevisedText>IA </span>granted authorization to download files on a
reoccurring basis must also follow the record requirements in this paragraph. 
Such record must include:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Date/time of transfer;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  Name of cleared U.S. citizen systems administrator
staff or authorized user who performed the transfer;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  Signature of the person requesting transfer;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(4)  Purpose of transfer;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(5)  Name(s) of transferred file(s); and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(6)  If it is discovered that a user is not following
the records requirements, the personnel who make the discovery must immediately
report this discrepancy to the ISSO and IRM/CO.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>h. File downloads to removable media for the purpose of
transferring files between a Department classified networked AIS and a
non-Department AIS must be performed via an intermediary standalone Department
AIS.  The files must be written to new removable media on the standalone AIS
and Department personnel must retain control of the media that was used on the
networked classified AIS through final disposition of the media.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>i.  The procedures for downloading files from
classified AIS to removable media in this section do not apply to sensitive
compartmented information (SCI) systems.  Requests for such transfers must be
made to the cognizant SCI information systems security officer.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  The cabinet cover for classified impact printers
must be closed and secured when operating.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. Users must process NODIS and EXDIS information under
the most stringent access controls available on the AIS.  NODIS and EXDIS
information should remain on the AIS only a minimal amount of time.  Users must
inform the data center manager and the system manager when NODIS and EXDIS
information is placed on the AIS.  The data center manager and the system
manager must delete or archive NODIS and EXDIS information from the AIS as soon
as it is no longer needed.</p>

Media and Output</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The data center manager and the systems manager must
instruct users to protect all media used on, and all hard copy material
generated by, classified AISs according to <a
href="https://usdos.sharepoint.com/sites/a-gis/dir/fam/Pages/12fam/12fam.aspx">12
FAM 500</a>, which defines requirements for marking, classifying and
declassifying, accountability, transportation, transmission, storage, and
destruction of national security information.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Media normally controlled by general users (e.g.,
removable disk packs, diskettes) must be appropriately stored in a container
approved for the storage of classified information.  The container must be
secured when unattended.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  For the purpose of this requirement, &quot;flash
drive&quot; refers to any removable flash memory, such as is normally found in
a thumb drive or in flash memory cards typically used with digital cameras and
other portable electronic devices.  Flash drives used for transferring
unclassified files between unclassified and classified systems must meet the
following requirements:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  The flash drive must be Department owned and
IT-CCB approved;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  The flash drive may only be used for the transfer
of unclassified files between unclassified and classified systems and must be
marked &#8220;SECRET (for ClassNet-OpenNet file transfer use only)&#8221;;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  The flash drive must be directly controlled by a
cleared American at all times and be stored in a container authorized for the
storage of classified material; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(4)  In order to use a flash drive for these types of
data transfers in a nonsystems administrator capacity, written approval by the
user&#8217;s supervisor or other management official is required.  The written
approval to use a flash drive may be included in a data transfer authorization,
and must be based on a need to perform recurring transfers and/or to move files
that are too large to be accommodated on available nonelectronic media (e.g., a
CD-R).</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. Media which has been used on an unclassified
mainframe or non<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>-</span>mainframe AIS may not be
loaded onto an AIS approved for classified processing unless specifically
authorized by DS/CTS and the Directorate of Cyber Operations (IRM/CO) or by the

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. A security review includes personnel,
administrative, system, and physical security practices.  DS/CTS will provide
post instructions which outline required report contents.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. DS/CTS will conduct periodic security evaluations of
classified mainframe and non<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>-</span>mainframe
AISs at posts.  These evaluations consider the threat environment and address
post implementation of applicable Federal and Department AIS security policies,
procedures, and requirements.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  IRM/FO/ITI/SI will conduct ongoing monitoring and
technical auditing of security controls on Department classified mainframe
AISs.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. The Mainframe Security Program manager must ensure
that an annual independent audit is performed on the security controls of all
mainframe AISs under his or her authority.  A copy of the audit findings should
be sent to IRM/FO/ITI/SI.</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(TL:DS-69;   06-22-2000)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText>The data center manager and the system manager ensure that
a system operations log is maintained for all classified AISs.  The log must
contain a record of all normal daily operations, system power-up and
power-down, media mounted and dismounted, backup and recovery operations, and
general environmental conditions.  Installation, removal, or modification of
system or application software must be noted in the log.  Any unusual events or
operating conditions must also be documented.  Logs will be maintained for a
minimum of six months from the date of the last entry or until the equipment is

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M637_3_1">12 FAM 637.3-1 </a> Access Controls</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-418;   09-27-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The data center manager and the system manager must
implement file, program, and data controls to limit access to users or groups
of users with the same need to know.  Need to know may be based on functional
responsibilities, operational requirements, supervisory responsibilities, or on
a combination of these factors.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. On non<span class=FAMNewRevisedText>-</span>mainframe
AISs, the system manager grants access privileges in three user categories:
system security administrators, system staff, and general users.  The access
privileges for each category are as follows:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  System security administrators (SSAs) have full
access to all system functions and all data on the AIS.  They are the only
users able to modify files containing individual system authentication data. 
The ISSO must assign SSA privileges to the minimum number of personnel required
for effective management of the AIS;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  System staff members have access to system
devices, programs, and resources; however, this level of access does not permit
modification of security parameters or changes to system files containing user
authentication data.  The ISSO must limit operator privileges, granting them
only to members of the system staff who require these privileges to perform
their system administration responsibilities; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  General users have access to applications and data
files based on supervisor-defined user profiles.  This level of system access
does not permit operator and system administrator functions.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  On mainframe AISs, the ISSO grants access
privileges in five user categories: system security administrators, system
staff, operations staff, programming staff, and general users.  The access
privileges for each category are as follows:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  System security administrators (SSAs), including
the ISSO, have full access to all system security functions and all
security-related data on the AIS.  They are the only users able to modify files
containing individual system authentication data.  SSA privileges must be
assigned to the minimum number of personnel required for effective security
management of the AIS;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  System staff members, including the system
manager, have access to all operating system related devices, programs, and
resources.  They are the only users authorized to update any component of the
operating system.  However, they are not permitted access to modify security
related data files or files containing user authentication data.  System staff
privileges must be granted only to members of the system staff who require them
to perform their system administration duties;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  Computer operations staff (e.g., operators,
schedulers, and change control technicians) have limited access to operating
system-related devices, programs, and resources.  They control production
workflow, allocate machine resources to tasks, monitor system and network
performance, and service peripheral devices.  They are not permitted system
security administrator privileges.  Operator privileges must be granted only to
members of the operations staff who require them to perform their duties;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(4)  Programming staff have access to their
application-specific programs, libraries, test data files, etc.  This level
does not permit computer operations, system staff, or system security
administrator privileges.  Programming privileges must be granted only to
members of the programming staff who require them to perform their duties; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(5)  General users have access to applications and data
files based on program manager defined user profiles.  This level of system
access does not permit programming, computer operations, system staff, or
system security administrator privileges.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading14><a name="M637_3_2">12 FAM 637.3-2 </a> Workstations and
