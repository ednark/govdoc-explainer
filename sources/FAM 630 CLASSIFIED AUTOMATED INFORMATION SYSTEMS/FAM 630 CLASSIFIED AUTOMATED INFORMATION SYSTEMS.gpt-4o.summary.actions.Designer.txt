Sure, hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions for a Designer (specializing in Human Centered Design) to show compliance with the standards:

1. **Access Appropriate Tools:**
   - Ensure design tools comply with security standards and are used on approved hardware.
  
2. **User Access Authorization:**
   - Design UI elements that incorporate secure user login with Smart Cards and passphrases.
   
3. **Role-Based Access:**
   - Create clear visual distinctions in the UI for different user access levels to ensure users only access information needed for their role.

4. **Session Management:**
   - Implement and visually indicate automatic logout features after periods of inactivity.
   
5. **Error Monitoring:**
   - Design error messages for failed logins to limit the number of visible attempts (maximum five).

6. **Temporary Access Design:**
   - Ensure UI accommodates temporary user IDs and Smart Cards, including indicating usage limits and access duration.

7. **Audit Trails:**
   - Include logs and prompts within the UI for real-time submission of audit trails and activity monitoring.

8. **Accessibility Labels:**
   - Clearly label all UI elements related to security (classified data indicators, user roles, etc.).

9. **Training Materials:**
   - Develop user-friendly guides and tutorials that instruct users on security best practices related to the interface and application use.
   
10. **Security Incident Reporting:**
    - Incorporate straightforward options within the interface for users to report security incidents or issues immediately.

By taking these actions, a designer can ensure that the user experience and user interface elements of the web application are designed in compliance with the mentioned standards, focusing on secure, user-friendly interactions.
