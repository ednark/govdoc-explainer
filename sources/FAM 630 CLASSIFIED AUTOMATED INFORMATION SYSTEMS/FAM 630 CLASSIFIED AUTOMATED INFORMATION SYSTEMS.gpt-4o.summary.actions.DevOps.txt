Here is a minimal list of actions that a DevOps technician must take to ensure compliance with the provided government standards for a web application:

1. **Ensure Secret Clearances:**
   - Verify that all system administrators have a Top Secret security clearance.
   - Confirm that all personnel with access to classified AISs have at least a Secret security clearance.

2. **Access Control:**
   - Configure user access privileges based on official duties and separation of duties.
   - Annually review and document user access privileges.

3. **Authentication:**
   - Implement user identification, Smart Card, and passphrase authentication on networked systems.
   - Use unique user IDs and prohibit group IDs and shared passwords.

4. **Audit and Logging:**
   - Maintain and securely store logs for system access requests, maintenance logs, audit trails, and other relevant activities for at least six months.
   - Review audit logs monthly for security-related anomalies.

5. **Backup and Contingency Planning:**
   - Implement and document a full backup procedure.
   - Store backup media in an approved, secure location.

6. **Media and Software Management:**
   - Ensure that software and media used are Department-approved and classified properly.
   - Provide proper training for downloading files to and from classified AISs.

7. **User Training:**
   - Ensure all personnel with system access have received site-specific AIS security training.

8. **Equipment and Environment Security:**
   - Ensure all AIS equipment is located within a secure area (e.g., Controlled Access Area).
   - Regularly conduct security reviews for physical and environmental protection systems (e.g., fire detection and suppression).

9. **Incident Response:**
   - Document and report any security-related abnormal system operation or incidents immediately to the ISSO and other relevant authorities.

10. **Technical Maintenance:**
    - Verify that only authorized Top Secret-cleared personnel perform system maintenance.
    - Record all maintenance activities in a maintenance log.

By consistently applying these measures, a DevOps technician can design and manage infrastructure that supports compliance with the specified government standards.
