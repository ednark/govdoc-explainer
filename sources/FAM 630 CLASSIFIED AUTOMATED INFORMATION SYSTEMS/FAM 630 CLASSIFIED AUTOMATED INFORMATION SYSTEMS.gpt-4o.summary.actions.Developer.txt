For a web application, specifically for a developer specializing in implementing Drupal, here is a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with the government standards document:

1. **Secure Access Controls**: Implement user roles and permissions to ensure users have only the access necessary for their responsibilities (12 FAM 631.3-2).
2. **User Authentication**: Configure systems to require user identification and authentication using Smart Cards and passphrases (12 FAM 632.1-4).
3. **Password Policies**: Ensure passwords meet complexity requirements and are changed according to the specified schedule (12 FAM 632.1-4(B)).
4. **Secure Data Storage**: Use proper methods for labeling and storing backup media according to classification levels (12 FAM 632.3-1).
5. **Auditing and Logging**: Generate and review audit logs monthly for security-related incidents (12 FAM 632.1-11).
6. **Media Protection**: Instruct users to handle all hard copy output and media according to security classification guidelines (12 FAM 632.1-6).
7. **Incident Reporting**: Document and report any abnormal system operations or security incidents immediately (12 FAM 632.1-7).
8. **System Separation**: Ensure there is no interconnectivity between classified and unclassified systems (12 FAM 634.1).
9. **Physical Security**: Verify that all system components are secure and located within controlled access areas (12 FAM 634.1).
10. **Data Transfers**: Follow strict procedures for transferring data between classified and unclassified systems (12 FAM 635.2).
11. **Regular Backups**: Implement and document a full backup procedure for system programs and data (12 FAM 632.3-1).

These actions should help to ensure the backend business logic aligns with the security and operational standards required for classified information systems.
