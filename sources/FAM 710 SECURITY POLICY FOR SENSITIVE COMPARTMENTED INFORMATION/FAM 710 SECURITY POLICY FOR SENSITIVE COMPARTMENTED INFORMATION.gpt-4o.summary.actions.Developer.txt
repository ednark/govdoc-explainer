Sure, focusing on the perspective of a Drupal developer implementing backend business logic, here are the minimal actions required to show compliance with the standards outlined in the Government Standards Document:

1. **User Authentication and Role Management**
   - Implement SCI access controls based on user roles.
   - Ensure proper user authentication measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

2. **Data Security and Encryption**
   - Ensure all SCI data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
   - Implement security measures for uploading, storing, and accessing SCI-related data.

3. **Access Controls and Permissions**
   - Set up fine-grained permissions to ensure only authorized users can access specific SCI data and features.
   - Regularly audit permissions and user roles.

4. **Audit Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement logging mechanisms to record access and modification of SCI data.
   - Set up monitoring to detect unauthorized access or actions involving SCI data.

5. **Session Management**
   - Ensure sessions are managed securely, with automatic timeouts and re-authentication requirements.

6. **Compliance Documentation**
   - Maintain documentation outlining the security measures implemented.
   - Ensure regular updates and reviews of security protocols.

7. **Data Handling Procedures**
   - Define and implement procedures for proper handling, storage, transmission, and disposal of SCI data according to the standards.

8. **Security Reviews and Education**
   - Participate in mandatory security training and briefings as required by the standards.
   - Regularly update and patch the Drupal application to mitigate vulnerabilities.

9. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Establish and document an incident response plan for handling security breaches or incidents related to SCI data.

10. **Code Review and Testing**
    - Conduct regular code reviews focusing on security vulnerabilities.
    - Implement automated security testing tools to identify potential risks in the codebase.

These concise steps ensure that the necessary security measures are incorporated into the application's development lifecycle, specifically for handling and safeguarding Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).
