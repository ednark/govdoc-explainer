For a Designer working on Human Centered Design and User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI) for a government web application, the following minimal list of actions will show compliance with the relevant standards:

1. **User Research**:
   - Conduct user interviews and surveys to understand the needs and experiences of the target audience.

2. **Accessibility Compliance**:
   - Ensure the design meets WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards to be accessible to users of all abilities.
   
3. **Simplify Navigation**:
   - Design clear and intuitive navigation to reduce complexity and time needed to find information.

4. **Empirical Customer Research**:
   - Use data and behavioral science insights to inform design decisions and improve user satisfaction.

5. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct usability testing with diverse user groups to identify pain points and areas for improvement.

6. **Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Implement easy-to-use feedback forms within the application to gather continuous user input.

7. **Clean and Intelligible UI**:
   - Design interfaces that are clear, easy to understand, and free from unnecessary complexity.

8. **Mobile-Friendly Design**:
   - Create responsive designs that work seamlessly across all devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

9. **Efficient Task Flows**:
   - Optimize task flows to minimize the "time tax" by reducing the number of steps to complete key actions.

10. **Error Prevention and Handling**:
    - Design proactive error prevention and user-friendly error messages to assist users in real-time.

11. **Consistency**:
    - Maintain consistency in design elements and terminology throughout the site for easier navigation.

12. **Privacy and Security**:
    - Design interfaces keeping in mind the protection of user privacy and data security requirements.

13. **Human-Centered Design Methodologies**:
    - Apply iterative design processes involving user feedback (e.g., prototyping, wireframing) to create user-focused solutions.

By adhering to these actions, a Designer can ensure that the web application aligns with government standards for user experience and service delivery.
