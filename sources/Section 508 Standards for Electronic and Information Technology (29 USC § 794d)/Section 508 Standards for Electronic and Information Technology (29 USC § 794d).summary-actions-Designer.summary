As a designer specializing in Human-Centered Design, to ensure compliance with Section 508 and related accessibility standards on a web application project, focus on the following practical actions:

1. **Familiarize with Section 508 Standards**: Understand the essentials of Section 508 standards. Ensure that all aspects of electronic and information technology are accessible to people with disabilities. 

2. **Integrate WCAG 2.0 Guidelines**: Design your web application in alignment with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Implement guidelines related to text alternatives for non-text content, adaptable layouts, accessible by keyboard, and time-based media alternatives.

3. **Design for All Users**: Employ principles of Universal Design to create an interface convenient for all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This includes color contrast, font sizes, button sizes, and interactive elements that are easy to navigate.

4. **Conduct Accessibility Testing**: Regularly perform accessibility testing throughout the design process using tools that simulate the web interface's experience for users with various disabilities. Employ automated tools as well as manual testing by users with disabilities to ensure thorough coverage.

5. **Document Accessibility Features**: Clearly document the accessibility features of the web application. This documentation should include details on how the application complies with each relevant Section 508 standard and how users can utilize accessibility features.

6. **Continuous User Feedback**: Set up channels for users to provide feedback specifically about the accessibility and usability of the application. Use this feedback to make continuous improvements.

7 *Update and Maintain Compliance*: Regularly update the application to keep up with advances in accessibility standards and technology. Ensure continued compliance with existing regulations and prepare for future updates to accessibility legislation.

Implementing these actions will help demonstrate commitment to compliance with government accessibility standards and ensure that the web application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
