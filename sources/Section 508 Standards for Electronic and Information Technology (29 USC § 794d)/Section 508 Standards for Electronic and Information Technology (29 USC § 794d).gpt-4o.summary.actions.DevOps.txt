Certainly! Here are the minimal actions a DevOps technician must take to ensure compliance with Section 508 standards for a web application:

1. **Ensure Infrastructure Compatibility**:
   - Verify that the hosting environment supports accessible technologies and standards like WCAG 2.0.

2. **Automated Accessibility Testing**:
   - Integrate automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe-core) into CI/CD pipelines to catch and resolve accessibility issues early.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Implement logging and monitoring focused on accessibility errors and compliance, track their resolution.

4. **Secure Communication Protocols**:
   - Ensure secure and accessible communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) are used and maintained.

5. **Redundancy and Reliability**:
   - Design and maintain infrastructure redundancy to ensure consistent, reliable access for users with disabilities.

6. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Establish secure, automated backup and recovery procedures to maintain data integrity and availability.

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize server performance to support screen readers and other assistive technologies without lag or downtime.

8. **Data Privacy Compliance**:
   - Implement data privacy measures compliant with relevant laws to protect user information, particularly sensitive data related to disability.

9. **Accessibility Statements**:
   - Host and maintain an accessibility statement on the web application in line with OMB requirements.

10. **Regular Updates**:
   - Schedule and perform regular updates to infrastructure and software to stay current with evolving accessibility standards.

By following these actions, DevOps technicians can ensure their infrastructure supports the necessary accessibility requirements defined by Section 508 standards.
