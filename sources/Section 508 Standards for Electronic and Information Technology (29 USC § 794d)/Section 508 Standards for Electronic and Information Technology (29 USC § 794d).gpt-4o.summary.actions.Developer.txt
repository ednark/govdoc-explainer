Certainly! Here’s a minimal list of actions that a developer specializing in Drupal should take to show compliance with Section 508 standards:

1. **Familiarize with WCAG 2.0 Guidelines:**
   - Review the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) as they are harmonized with Section 508 Standards.

2. **Use Accessible Themes and Templates:**
   - Select Drupal themes and templates that are already compliant with WCAG 2.0.

3. **Implement ARIA Landmarks:**
   - Use Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) landmarks to define regions of the page (e.g., banners, navigation, main content).

4. **Ensure Keyboard Navigation:**
   - Make sure all interactive elements (links, buttons, forms) can be navigated using the keyboard.

5. **Text Alternatives:**
   - Provide text alternatives (alt attributes) for all non-text content like images, videos, and audio.

6. **Form Accessibility:**
   - Use labels and fieldsets for form elements to ensure they are accessible to screen readers.

7. **Color Contrast:**
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background to make content readable for users with visual impairments.

8. **Descriptive Link Text:**
   - Use descriptive text for links, avoiding vague terms like “click here” or “read more”.

9. **Error Identification:**
   - Make error messages clear and provide context-sensitive help for form errors.

10. **Focus Management:**
    - Ensure logical tab order for page elements and proper focus management for dynamically loaded content.

11. **Captions and Transcripts:**
    - Provide captions for video content and transcripts for audio content.

12. **Test with Assistive Technologies:**
    - Regularly test the website with screen readers and other assistive technologies to ensure accessibility.

13. **Update and Maintenance:**
    - Continuously update and maintain the website for compliance as new content is added or updated.

Each of these steps can help ensure that your web application meets Section 508 standards and provides comparable access to users with disabilities.
