To ensure compliance with Section 508 and related standards for a web application project, a Project Manager should undertake the following key actions:

1. **Assess Accessibility Requirements:**
   Review Section 508 Standards, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) related sections, and the 2017 ICT Final Standards and Guidelines to fully understand the accessibility requirements that need to be met.

2. **Integrate Accessibility in Project Planning:**
   Include accessibility criteria in your project scope and incorporate accessibility standards in the written acquisition plans as detailed in FAR 7.105(5)(iv).

3. **Conduct Market Research:**
   Execute comprehensive market research following FAR 12.202(d) to identify and evaluate existing technology solutions that meet the accessibility standards.

4. **Document Accessibility Needs:**
   Prepare documentation outlining the accessibility needs of users as required by FAR 11.002(f). Include user needs, applicable standards, and document any exceptions or justifications for not meeting certain standards.

5. **Vendor Evaluation and Selection:**
   When procuring services or products, ensure that vendors can demonstrate compliance with Section 508 Standards. Assess their previous work and commitment to accessibility.

6. **Accessibility Testing:**
   Implement an ongoing process to test the web application for compliance with WCAG 2.0 guidelines as harmonized under the updated Section 508 standards. Use both automated tools and manual testing methodologies.

7. **Training and Awareness:**
   Organize training sessions for developers and content creators on accessibility guidelines and standards. Ensure that the project team understands their roles in maintaining compliance.

8. **Maintain Documentation and Reporting:**
   Keep detailed records of compliance efforts, any deviations or exemptions, and remediation actions taken. These documents could be crucial for audits and assessments.

9. **Review and Update Policies:**
   Regularly update your project and organizational policies based on changes in laws or advancements in accessibility technologies as suggested in the Government Standards Document.

10. **Client and Stakeholder Engagement:**
    Continuously engage with the client and stakeholders, reporting on progress related to accessibility and taking their feedback to refine the approach.

These actions will help in structuring a project that adheres to Section 508 and associated accessibility standards, ensuring that the web application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
