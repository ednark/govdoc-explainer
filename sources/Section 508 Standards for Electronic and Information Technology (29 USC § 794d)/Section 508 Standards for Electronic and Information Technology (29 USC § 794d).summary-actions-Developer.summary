As a Developer specializing in Drupal implementation, here are the minimal steps you must take to ensure compliance with the standards specified in Section 508 in a web application project:

1. **Familiarize with Section 508 Standards:** Understand the updated Section 508 standards particularly relating to Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Review the key elements that pertain to web applications.

2. **Adopt WCAG 2.0 Guidelines:** Integrate the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 into your development process, which Section 508 has been harmonized with. Focus on principles of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR) content creation.

3. **Accessibility Testing:** Regularly test your application for accessibility during the development phase using both automated tools and manual testing. Include tests for screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.

4. **Semantic Markup:** Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements to ensure the content structure is accessible. This includes properly using headers, lists, forms, and other structural elements.

5. **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles and Properties:** Apply ARIA roles and properties correctly to enhance accessibility, particularly for dynamic content and complex user interface components created with JavaScript.

6. **Accessible Forms:** Ensure that all form elements are labeled appropriately, include clear instructions, and provide immediate, accessible error messages and feedback.

7. **Multimedia Accessibility:** Provide text captions and audio descriptions for multimedia content. Ensure that all video players used are accessible.

8. **Assistive Technologies Compatibility:** Guarantee compatibility with leading screen readers, magnification software, and other assistive technologies typically used by people with disabilities.

9. **Documentation and Reporting:** Keep detailed records of accessibility measures implemented, and prepare to report on these measures if required by procurement officials or Section 508 Program Managers.

10. **Training and Resources:** Stay updated with the latest accessibility guidelines and best practices. Engage in training sessions, and utilize resources like webinars, updated guidelines from the U.S. Access Board, or consultations with accessibility experts.
