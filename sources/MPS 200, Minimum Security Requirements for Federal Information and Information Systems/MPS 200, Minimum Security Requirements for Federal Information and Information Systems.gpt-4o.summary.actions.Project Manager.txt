Certainly, here is a minimal list of actions for a Project Manager to track and organize compliance with the FIPS 200 standards for a web application:

1. **Access Control**
   - Implement user access control based on least privilege.
   - Ensure role-based access control is defined and enforced.

2. **Awareness and Training**
   - Conduct security training for all team members.
   - Document training sessions and attendance.

3. **Audit and Accountability**
   - Enable audit logging for security-relevant events.
   - Regularly review audit logs for unusual activity.

4. **Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring**
   - Perform initial risk assessments.
   - Obtain necessary security authorizations before deployment.
   - Continuously monitor for security threats.

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Document and control changes to application configurations.
   - Ensure secure configurations are maintained.

6. **Contingency Planning**
   - Develop and test a disaster recovery plan.
   - Ensure backup and recovery measures are in place.

7. **Identification and Authentication**
   - Implement robust identification and authentication mechanisms.
   - Require multi-factor authentication for sensitive areas.

8. **Incident Response**
   - Create and maintain an incident response plan.
   - Train relevant personnel on incident response procedures.

9. **Maintenance**
   - Regularly update and patch software.
   - Document maintenance activities and schedules.

10. **Media Protection**
    - Securely handle and dispose of sensitive media.
    - Encrypt data on all storage media.

11. **Physical and Environmental Protection**
    - Restrict physical access to hardware.
    - Ensure environmental controls (e.g., HVAC, fire suppression) are operational.

12. **Planning**
    - Develop a system security plan.
    - Integrate security planning into the project lifecycle.

13. **Personnel Security**
    - Conduct background checks for personnel handling sensitive information.
    - Define roles and responsibilities clearly.

14. **Risk Assessment**
    - Perform risk assessments periodically.
    - Document findings and implement mitigation measures.

15. **System and Services Acquisition**
    - Ensure third-party services comply with security requirements.
    - Include security clauses in contracts and agreements.

16. **System and Communications Protection**
    - Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
    - Implement network security controls (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS).

17. **System and Information Integrity**
    - Implement malware protection.
    - Regularly scan and protect against vulnerabilities.

Tracking and ensuring completion of these tasks should help in demonstrating compliance with the minimum security requirements set by FIPS 200.
