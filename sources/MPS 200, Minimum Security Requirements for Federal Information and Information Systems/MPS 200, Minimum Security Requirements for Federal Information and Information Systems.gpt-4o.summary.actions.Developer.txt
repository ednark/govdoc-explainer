Certainly! Hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions tailored for a Drupal developer to show compliance with FIPS 200 standards:

1. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure users have the minimum necessary permissions.
2. **Awareness and Training**: Make sure developers and administrators understand security configurations within Drupal.
3. **Audit and Accountability**: Enable and configure logging for all administrative actions and sensitive data access.
4. **Configuration Management**: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) and config management tools (e.g., Drupal Configuration Management) to track changes.
5. **Contingency Planning**: Regularly back up the database and configuration and store backups securely.
6. **Identification and Authentication**: Use strong, unique passwords and integrate multi-factor authentication (MFA).
7. **Incident Response**: Install and configure modules to detect and respond to security incidents (e.g., Security Kit, Fail2Ban).
8. **Maintenance**: Regularly apply Drupal core and module updates to address security vulnerabilities.
9. **Media Protection**: Ensure that uploaded files are sanitized and access to sensitive files is restricted.
10. **Physical and Environmental Protection**: Ensure server hosting the Drupal site has adequate physical security measures.
11. **Planning**: Document security processes and configurations in the project's documentation.
12. **Personnel Security**: Limit access to the application and hosting environment to trusted personnel only.
13. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct regular security reviews and vulnerability assessments.
14. **System and Services Acquisition**: Use secure, verified Drupal modules and third-party libraries.
15. **System and Communications Protection**: Use TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit.
16. **System and Information Integrity**: Install security modules (e.g., CAPTCHA, Honeypot) to protect against common vulnerabilities.

These steps, if diligently followed, should help ensure compliance with FIPS 200 standards from a developer's perspective implementing Drupal.
