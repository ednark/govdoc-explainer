For a DevOps technician, the following minimal list of actions should be taken to ensure compliance with FIPS 200 standards for web applications:

1. **Access Control:**
   - Implement role-based access controls to restrict access to authorized personnel.
   - Regularly review and update access permissions.

2. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct regular security training for all team members.
   - Ensure all personnel are aware of security policies and procedures.

3. **Audit and Accountability:**
   - Enable logging and monitoring to capture user activities and system events.
   - Implement mechanisms for audit trail preservation and review.

4. **Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring:**
   - Perform security assessments and risk analysis regularly.
   - Gain necessary authorization for system changes.
   - Continuously monitor for security threats and anomalies.

5. **Configuration Management:**
   - Maintain an inventory of all system components.
   - Apply and document all configuration changes systematically.
   - Implement and enforce configuration baselines.

6. **Contingency Planning:**
   - Develop and regularly update a disaster recovery plan.
   - Conduct periodic backup and restore tests.

7. **Identification and Authentication:**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for system access.
   - Ensure robust password policies and periodic password changes.

8. **Incident Response:**
   - Set up an incident response plan.
   - Implement systems for incident detection and analysis.
   - Perform timely reporting and response to security incidents.

9. **Maintenance:**
   - Schedule regular system maintenance activities.
   - Document and track all maintenance efforts and results.

10. **Media Protection:**
    - Control access to physical media and digital storage devices.
    - Implement encryption for sensitive information.

11. **Physical and Environmental Protection:**
    - Ensure physical security of data centers and server rooms.
    - Implement environmental controls (temperature, humidity).

12. **Planning:**
    - Maintain a security plan detailing the systemâ€™s compliance measures.
    - Update the plan regularly based on assessments and changes.

13. **Personnel Security:**
    - Conduct background checks for employees with system access.
    - Define and enforce security roles and responsibilities.

14. **Risk Assessment:**
    - Conduct regular risk assessments and document findings.
    - Mitigate identified risks with relevant controls.

15. **System and Services Acquisition:**
    - Ensure third-party services and hardware comply with security standards.
    - Document all system and service acquisitions.

16. **System and Communications Protection:**
    - Implement firewall and intrusion detection systems.
    - Encrypt data in transit and at rest.

17. **System and Information Integrity:**
    - Regularly update and patch systems.
    - Implement anti-virus and anti-malware solutions.

By ensuring these actions are taken, a DevOps technician can contribute significantly towards meeting the minimum security requirements stipulated by FIPS 200 for federal information systems.
