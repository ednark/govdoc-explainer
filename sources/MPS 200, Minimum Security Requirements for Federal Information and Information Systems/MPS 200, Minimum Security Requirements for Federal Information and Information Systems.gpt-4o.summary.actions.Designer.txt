For a web application to comply with FIPS 200 standards from a Human Centered Design (HCD) perspective, focusing on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI), here is a concise list of key actions a Designer must take:

1. **Access Control:**
   - Ensure secure login interfaces with robust user authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

2. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Design user-friendly training materials and on-boarding processes for users to understand security protocols.

3. **Audit and Accountability:**
   - Implement clear user activities logging that users are made aware of through UI prompts or notifications.

4. **Identification and Authentication:**
   - Develop intuitive interfaces for user identification and verification processes.

5. **System and Communications Protection:**
   - Design secure communication features, ensuring visual indications of secure connections (e.g., HTTPS, padlock icons).

6. **Incident Response:**
   - Create accessible interfaces for users to report security incidents and receive timely feedback.

7. **Maintenance:**
   - Provide clear notifications and information about system maintenance and updates that may affect users.

8. **Media Protection:**
   - Design interfaces that ensure secure handling and disposal of sensitive data.

9. **Physical and Environmental Protection:**
   - Ensure UI design incorporates options for biometric security measures, if applicable.

10. **System and Information Integrity:**
    - Implement interfaces that allow users to verify data integrity and receive alerts about potential integrity issues.

11. **Risk Assessment:**
    - Incorporate user risk assessments into the design process to identify potential security vulnerabilities from a user perspective.

By focusing on these actions, a Designer can ensure that the UIs and UX are aligned with the minimum security requirements dictated by the FIPS 200 standards.
