For a Designer focusing on Human-Centered Design, UX, and UI of a web application, the following minimal list of actions is necessary to demonstrate compliance with government standards concerning DNSSEC:

1. **Understand DNSSEC Basics**: Gain a basic understanding of DNSSEC to ensure design decisions do not inhibit its function.
2. **User Communication**: Ensure the user interface clearly communicates security features, such as displaying secure domain indicators.
3. **Security Alerts**: Design prompts or alerts to notify users if there is a potential security issue related to DNS.
4. **Performance Considerations**: Design with awareness of potential DNSSEC-related latency, ensuring minimal impact on user experience.
5. **Accessibility Alignment**: Ensure that any DNSSEC-related notifications or features adhere to accessibility standards.
6. **Consistency in Design**: Maintain consistent design elements to build user trust in the secure nature of the application.
7. **Testing and Feedback**: Include DNSSEC-related user interactions in usability testing to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

By implementing these actions, the designer ensures that the user experience is aligned with DNSSEC requirements and effectively communicates security to the end-users.
