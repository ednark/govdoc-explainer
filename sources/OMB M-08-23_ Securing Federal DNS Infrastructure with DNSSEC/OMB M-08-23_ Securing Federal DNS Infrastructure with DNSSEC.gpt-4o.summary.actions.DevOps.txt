As a DevOps technician ensuring our web application complies with the government standards for DNSSEC, you should focus on the following actions:

1. **Enumerate .gov Domains**
   - List all second-level domains under our agency's .gov.

2. **Identify Sources of DNS Services**
   - Determine if DNS services are managed in-house, outsourced, or provided by another agency.

3. **Describe DNS Server Infrastructure**
   - Document DNS software in use (e.g., BIND, NSD, Microsoft Advanced Directory).
   - Record the number of DNS servers per source.

4. **Enable DNSSEC on DNS Servers**
   - Configure DNS servers to support and use DNSSEC.
   - Ensure all relevant zones are DNSSEC-signed.

5. **DNSSEC Key Management**
   - Implement procedures for generating, storing, and rotating DNSSEC keys.

6. **Test DNSSEC Deployment**
   - Conduct internal and external tests to validate DNSSEC configurations.

7. **Monitor and Log DNSSEC Activities**
   - Set up monitoring and logging to detect DNSSEC-related issues.

8. **Address Technical Barriers**
   - Identify and document any technical issues impeding DNSSEC deployment.
   - Plan and execute steps to overcome these barriers.

9. **Participate in DNSSEC Training and Pilots**
   - Engage with the Secure Naming Infrastructure Pilot (SNIP) for training and testing.

10. **Plan of Action and Milestones**
    - Create a detailed plan outlining key activities and milestones for full DNSSEC deployment by the given deadline.

By focusing on these actions, you can ensure that the web application infrastructure aligns with the DNSSEC requirements specified in the government standards document.
