As a DevOps technician, to ensure compliance with FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Performance Management Guide for a web application, you should consider the following actions:

1. **Implement Continuous Monitoring (ConMon):**
   - Set up tools for real-time monitoring and logging of systems.

2. **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:**
   - Schedule and perform authenticated scans at least monthly.
   - Ensure scans cover all systems and critical components.

3. **Patch and Mitigation Management:**
   - Apply security patches and mitigate vulnerabilities within designated timeframes (30 days for high, 60 days for medium).

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Implement an incident response plan.
   - Ensure timely notification and detailed logging of any security incidents.

5. **Configuration Management:**
   - Maintain an inventory of system components.
   - Employ automated tools to enforce configuration settings and check compliance.

6. **Access Controls and Authentication:**
   - Enforce strong, multi-factor authentication for all privileged access.
   - Regularly review and update access controls.

7. **Change Control Procedures:**
   - Document and review all changes to the infrastructure.
   - Ensure changes follow an approval process and include security impact analysis.

8. **Backup and Recovery Planning:**
   - Implement regular data backup schedules.
   - Test recovery procedures periodically.

9. **Network Security:**
   - Deploy firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and secure network configurations.
   - Regularly review and update network security policies.

10. **Compliance Reporting:**
    - Generate and submit required monthly and annual compliance reports.
    - Maintain documentation of all ConMon activities and findings.

Adhering to these actions should help ensure that the infrastructure supporting your web application is compliant with FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring requirements.
