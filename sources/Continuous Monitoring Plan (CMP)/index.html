About This Document
This document provides guidance on continuous monitoring (ConMon) and ongoing authorization
in support of maintaining a security authorization that meets the Federal Risk and Authorization
Management Program (FedRAMP) ConMon requirements. This document is not a FedRAMP template – there is nothing to fill out in this document. This document uses the term authorizing official (AO). For cloud service offerings (CSOs) with a
Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO), AO refers to the JAB
unless this document explicitly says agency AO. For CSOs with a FedRAMP authorization, agency
AO refers to each leveraging federal agency’s AO. Who Should Use This Document? This document is intended to be used by cloud service providers (CSPs), third party assessment
organizations (3PAOs), federal agency AOs, and federal agency employees/contractors working
on FedRAMP projects. This document may also prove useful for other organizations that are
developing a ConMon program. How To Contact Us

1. Introduction
Section 2 of this document explains the actions the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO)
and the JAB take when a CSP fails to maintain an adequate ConMon capability for a CSO with a
JAB P-ATO. Section 3 of this document provides a recommended process that agencies should use
to monitor ConMon performance for CSOs with a FedRAMP agency authorization and
recommended actions to take when a CSP fails to maintain an adequate ConMon capability for
the CSO. The FedRAMP ConMon process is based on the ConMon process described in the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-137, Information
Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, and is
governed by the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide. The FedRAMP ConMon process goals are to provide: (i) operational visibility; (ii) managed change
control; and (iii) attendance to incident response duties. Security-related information collected
during ConMon is used to determine if the system security is operating as intended and in
accordance with applicable federal law, guidelines, and policies. When a CSP receives a JAB P-ATO letter for a CSO, that letter comes with the following minimum
requirements :
1
1.</div><div id="chunk-2" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The CSP satisfies the requirement of implementing ConMon activities as documented in
FedRAMP’s Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide and the CSP’s ConMon plan;
2. The CSP mitigates all open Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) action items agreed to
in the Security Assessment Report (SAR) within the appropriate timeframe as defined in
the agreed POA&M; and
3. The CSP identifies and manages significant changes or critical vulnerabilities in
accordance with applicable federal law, guidelines, and policies. Further, by accepting the requirements outlined in the letter, a CSP agrees to fulfill the guidance in
2
the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide, including maintaining operational visibility,
change control, and incident response functions defined in that document. In addition, a CSP is
expected to continue to follow NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information
Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy, and related
NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) guidance and to effectively deploy all applicable
security controls as well as act in good faith to maintain the appropriate risk posture. 2 Additional requirements may be included in a JAB P-ATO or agency ATO letter to address system-specific security concerns
identified during an assessment. 1 Agency AOs are encouraged to use the FedRAMP ATO Letter Template which includes these requirements. The template can be
found on the FedRAMP Documents and Templates page. fedramp.gov
FedRAMP® Continuous Monitoring
Performance Management Guide
Failure to adhere to the requirements of a P-ATO may result in escalation actions by FedRAMP,
outlined in subsequent sections of this document, as well as additional actions as FedRAMP
deems appropriate. While much of this document specifically addresses FedRAMP P-ATOs maintained by the JAB,
CSOs authorized via the FedRAMP agency authorization path must also maintain compliance
with FedRAMP ConMon requirements.</div><div id="chunk-3" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> As outlined in Section 3, Agency ATO Performance
Management, FedRAMP recommends agencies to create similar guides and/or use this FedRAMP
Continuous Monitoring Performance Management Guide when maintaining FedRAMP agency
authorizations. A summary of FedRAMP and agency performance management responsibilities
for CSOs authorized via the FedRAMP agency authorization path is provided in Section 3. 2. JAB P-ATO Performance Management
This section provides the processes that the FedRAMP PMO and JAB use to perform oversight of
ConMon performance for CSOs with JAB P-ATOs. 2.1
JAB Escalation Levels and Process
As a condition of a JAB P-ATO, a CSP agrees to meet the requirements described in the FedRAMP
Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide. If the CSP fails to meet the requirements, FedRAMP
initiates an escalation process, which may result in one of the following escalation levels:
●
Detailed Finding Review (DFR): A request from a CSP’s FedRAMP Point of Contact (POC)
to have the CSP assess a deficiency and report the cause and remedy to FedRAMP. If the
CSP does not resolve a DFR within the agreed upon timeframe, FedRAMP may escalate to
a corrective action
plan (CAP). ●
CAP: A request from the FedRAMP Director for a CSP’s system owner to perform a
root-cause analysis and provide a formal plan for remediation. If the CSP does not resolve
a CAP within the agreed upon timeframe, FedRAMP may suspend or revoke the CSO’s
P-ATO. ●
Suspension: A decision by the JAB to temporarily suspend a CSO’s P-ATO until the
identified deficiencies are resolved.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> If the CSP does not resolve a “Suspension” within the
agreed upon timeframe, or if the FedRAMP Director and JAB determine the CSP can no
longer meet FedRAMP compliance requirements, FedRAMP may revoke the CSO’s P-ATO. fedramp.gov
FedRAMP® Continuous Monitoring
Performance Management Guide
●
Revocation: A decision by the JAB to permanently revoke a CSO’s P-ATO. If revoked, the
only way the CSO can obtain a P-ATO is by re-entering the FedRAMP JAB authorization
process as if the CSO were seeking a P-ATO for the first time. When FedRAMP identifies a deficiency in a CSP’s ConMon capabilities, it initiates the process
depicted in Figure 1. FedRAMP Escalation Process, below. Figure 1. FedRAMP Escalation Process
The escalation process occurs as follows:
1. FedRAMP identifies a deficiency with a CSP’s ConMon information. 2. FedRAMP reviews the deficiency and compares it to the CSP’s past ConMon
performance.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> As a result of the review, FedRAMP decides on one of the following actions:
●
FedRAMP typically decides on an escalation level consistent with the guidance
described in Section 2.2, JAB ConMon Requirements: Risk Management Deficiency
Triggers. ●
FedRAMP may elect to simply monitor the CSP more closely and take no further action. If so, no notice is sent, and the process stops here;
●
FedRAMP may increase the CSP’s existing escalation level; for example, a CSP on a
CAP may face “Suspension;” or
●
In rare cases, FedRAMP may determine the deficiency is severe enough to make the
escalation effective immediately, in which case, steps 3 and 4 are skipped. 3. FedRAMP sends a notification to the CSP of the deficiency and FedRAMP’s intended
escalation. Depending on the intended escalation level, the notice comes from:
●
The CSP’s FedRAMP POC for an intended DFR or CAP. ●
The FedRAMP Director and JAB Technical Representatives (TRs) for a “Suspension” or
“Revocation”. 4. The CSP responds to the notification. The CSP’s response should include any information
that may rebut an escalation decision.</div><div id="chunk-6" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Depending on the intended escalation level, the
CSP’s response must come from:
●
The CSP’s security POC for a DFR; or
●
The CSP’s system owner for a CAP, “Suspension”, or “Revocation”. 5. FedRAMP reviews and adjudicates the CSP’s response, and renders a formal
escalation decision. Depending on the escalation level, the decision is made by:
fedramp.gov
FedRAMP® Continuous Monitoring
Performance Management Guide
●
The FedRAMP POC for a DFR;
●
The FedRAMP Director and JAB TRs for a CAP; or
●
The JAB for a “Suspension” or “Revocation”. 6. FedRAMP notifies the CSP of its decision. If FedRAMP decides to follow through with an
escalation, this notice:
●
Identifies the criteria for returning the CSO to a “Satisfactory” status. In some cases, it
may also include a deadline by which the CSP must fully satisfy the criteria or face
more severe escalation; and
●
Requires certain actions from the CSP. Typically, FedRAMP requires the CSP to perform
a root-cause analysis and develop a formal plan for addressing the deficiencies. 7.</div><div id="chunk-7" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> CSP responds to the FedRAMP notification. This response must include:
●
The results of the root cause analysis;
●
The CSP’s plan for fully resolving the issues, with clearly established milestones and
dates, including a date of full resolution;
●
For a CAP or “Suspension”, the system owner’s signature on the plan; and
●
Any other items, as specified by FedRAMP in its notification. 8. FedRAMP reviews and renders a final decision on the CSP’s plan. Depending on the
escalation level, the decision is made by:
●
The FedRAMP POC for a DFR;
●
The FedRAMP Director and JAB TRs for a CAP; or
●
The JAB for a “Suspension” or “Revocation”. When a CSP is subject to escalation as described above, the following occurs:
●
Monthly ConMon Reporting to Leveraging Agencies: FedRAMP updates the next
monthly ConMon report to reflect the cited deficiencies, escalation level, and the CSP’s
identified resolution date. The CSO’s status is changed to “Minor Concern” for a DFR, or “Major Concern” for a CAP or
“Suspension”. The status remains and the CSP’s progress is reported each month until
FedRAMP determines the issue is fully resolved. FedRAMP discontinues ConMon reporting when the CSO’s P-ATO is revoked, but
continues ConMon reporting when the CSO’s P-ATO is suspended. ●
Other Postings and Notifications to Leveraging Agencies: If there is a CAP,
“Suspension”, or “Revocation”, FedRAMP posts a letter to the CSP’s secure repository for
review by the leveraging agencies as well as the CSP’s plan for resolution (where
appropriate).</div><div id="chunk-8" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The information is retained indefinitely for historical reference. If a CSO’s P-ATO is suspended or revoked, FedRAMP notifies each known leveraging
agency and requires the CSP to ensure the list of FedRAMP known leveraging agencies
matches the CSP’s customer list for the impacted CSO. Note: P-ATO “Revocation” does not automatically result in revocation of each leveraging
agency’s ATO. Each leveraging agency’s AO reviews the circumstances of the P-ATO
fedramp.gov
FedRAMP® Continuous Monitoring
Performance Management Guide
“Revocation” and makes a determination regarding the status of the ATO they issued for
the CSO on behalf of their agency. ●
FedRAMP Marketplace: FedRAMP updates the CSO’s status on the FedRAMP
Marketplace to reflect the escalation level for “Suspension”. FedRAMP removes the CSO
from the Marketplace if the P-ATO is revoked. DFRs and CAPs are not reflected on the
Marketplace. ●
Further Escalation: If a CSP fails to provide a plan acceptable to FedRAMP or fails to meet
the dates identified in the plan, FedRAMP may increase the escalation level. Further
escalation follows the escalation process steps described above. ●
Extension: If a CSP has made a good-faith effort to fully resolve the deficiency and
address the plan, but requires more time, the CSP may request an extension from
FedRAMP.</div><div id="chunk-9" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> When FedRAMP determines the CSP has fully resolved the cited deficiencies and satisfied the
FedRAMP-identified criteria communicated in the notification, FedRAMP takes the following
actions:
●
Notification to CSP: A CSP’s FedRAMP POC notifies a CSP’s security POC when
FedRAMP agrees a DFR is fully satisfied. The FedRAMP Director notifies the system owner
when FedRAMP agrees a CAP or “Suspension” is fully satisfied. ●
Monthly ConMon Reporting to Leveraging Agencies: FedRAMP updates the next
monthly report to reflect that all cited deficiencies are resolved and the escalation level is
no longer in effect. The status is returned to “Satisfactory.”
●
Other Postings and Notifications to Leveraging Agencies: The FedRAMP Director posts
a letter to the CSP’s secure repository indicating the CAP or “Suspension” is fully resolved
to FedRAMP’s satisfaction, and the CSP is once again in good standing. No letter is posted
when a DFR is initiated or when it is resolved. ●
FedRAMP Marketplace: FedRAMP returns the CSO’s status from indicating “Suspension”
to its normal listing with no indication of an escalation level. 2.2
JAB ConMon Requirements: Risk Management
Deficiency Triggers
To ensure consistent expectations and enforcement, FedRAMP defines risk management
deficiency “triggers.” When a CSP’s performance exceeds one or more of the thresholds, as
defined in Table 1 JAB Risk Management Deficiency Triggers below, FedRAMP will, at a minimum,
take the prescribed action. fedramp.gov

JAB Customer Demand
To remain eligible for a JAB P-ATO, FedRAMP requires a minimum of six unique agency customers
with authorizations that leverage a CSO’s JAB P-ATO directly or indirectly:
3
●
Each CSO’s direct agency customer is counted as one unit of demand. ●
For CSOs that are leveraged by other CSOs, each unique agency that the leveraging CSO
has as a customer will be counted as one unit of demand for the leveraged CSO. For
example, if CSO X is leveraged by CSO Z, and CSO Z has 15 authorizations with four
different department agencies, CSO X will receive a demand score of four from this
leveraging relationship. This score will be added to any other demand that CSO X has from
agencies or other leveraging relationships. FedRAMP evaluates CSP customer demand on an annual basis to ensure CSPs with P-ATOs are
meeting and maintaining FedRAMP demand thresholds. A CSP that has fewer than six unique FedRAMP ATOs in the FedRAMP secure repository will be
placed on a CAP at the discretion of the FedRAMP PMO and JAB. A CSP that cannot meet or
maintain this demand threshold has the opportunity to pursue a FedRAMP agency authorization,
in lieu of the P-ATO, with the support of the FedRAMP PMO. FedRAMP established this threshold based on JAB resources, to ensure JAB ConMon resources are
focused on CSOs that result in broader impact across the federal government. FedRAMP may
adjust this threshold at its discretion due to changes in available resources and overall demand
across the federal government for cloud services.</div><div id="chunk-11" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> 3. Agency ATO Performance
Management
This section provides recommendations for processes of how agencies should perform oversight
of CSOs authorized via the FedRAMP agency authorization path. NOTE: The initial authorizing agency (aka “partner”) is not responsible for performing ConMon
oversight on behalf of subsequent authorizing agencies. Each agency that issues an ATO, or
authority to use (ATU), for a cloud offering must review the CSP’s ConMon activities to ensure the
3 The FedRAMP PMO does not count a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) P-ATO as part of the unique agency
customer total, because it does not represent a true unique agency customer authorized to use a cloud service offering (CSO). fedramp.gov
FedRAMP® Continuous Monitoring
Performance Management Guide
security posture remains sufficient for its own use and supports an ongoing authorization. This
includes reviewing the monthly POA&Ms, approving deviation requests and significant change
requests, and reviewing the results of the annual assessment. For CSPs with more than one
agency ATO, security control CA-7|Continuous Monitoring requires the CSP to implement the
collaborative ConMon approach described in the FedRAMP Collaborative ConMon Quick Guide. Collaborative ConMon benefits agencies by allowing them to share responsibility for ConMon
oversight and performance management, and it benefits the CSP by creating a central forum for
addressing questions or performance concerns and for achieving consensus related to deviation
requests, significant change requests, and annual assessments (versus having to coordinate with
each agency separately). Similar to JAB performance management of CSOs with P-ATOs, agencies should implement an
escalation process to monitor their authorized CSOs, which may result in one of the following
escalation levels. Agency AOs (or collaborative ConMon groups) can determine which escalation
levels are appropriate:
●
Detailed Finding Review (DFR): A request from an agency AO (or collaborative ConMon
group) for a CSP’s security POC to assess a deficiency and report the cause and remedy to
the agency AO.</div><div id="chunk-12" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> If the CSP does not resolve a DFR within the agreed upon timeframe, the
agency AO may escalate to a corrective action plan (CAP). ●
CAP: A request from an agency AO (or collaborative ConMon group) for a CSP’s system
owner to perform a root-cause analysis and provide a formal plan for remediation. If the
CSP does not resolve a CAP within the agreed upon timeframe, the agency AO may
suspend or revoke the CSO’s ATO(s). ●
Suspension: A decision by an agency AO (or collaborative ConMon group) to temporarily
suspend a CSO’s ATO(s) until the identified deficiencies are resolved. In this phase, an
agency may choose to suspend use of the CSO. If the CSP does not resolve a “Suspension”
within the agreed upon timeframe or if the agency AO determines the CSP can no longer
meet FedRAMP compliance requirements, the agency AO may revoke the CSO’s ATO(s). ●
Revocation: A decision by an agency AO (or collaborative ConMon group) to revoke a
CSO’s ATO and migrate the data to another CSO. When an agency AO (or collaborative ConMon group) identifies a deficiency in the CSP’s ConMon
capabilities, the agency AO should initiate the escalation process described below. The escalation process occurs as follows:
1. The agency AO identifies a deficiency with a CSP’s ConMon information.</div><div id="chunk-13" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> 2. The Agency AO reviews the deficiency and compares it to the CSP’s past ConMon
performance. As a result of the review, the agency AO decides on one of the following

●
Identifies the criteria for returning the CSO to a “Satisfactory” status. It may also
include a deadline by which the CSP must fully satisfy the criteria or face more severe
escalation; and
●
Requires certain actions from the CSP. Typically, an agency AO would require the CSP
to perform a root-cause analysis and develop a formal plan for addressing the
deficiencies. 7. The CSP responds to the Agency AO notification. This response must include:
●
The results of the root cause analysis;
●
The CSP’s plan for fully resolving the issues, with clearly established milestones and
dates, including a date of full resolution;
●
For a CAP or “Suspension,” the system owner’s signature on the plan and agency AO
approval of the plan; and
●
Any other items as specified by the agency AO in the notification.</div><div id="chunk-15" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> When a CSP is subject to escalation as described above, the following occurs:
●
Notification to FedRAMP: Agency AOs must notify FedRAMP at info@fedramp.gov if a
decision is made to initiate “Suspension” or “Revocation.” CAP letters should be uploaded
to the FedRAMP secure repository. When the agency AO determines the CSP has fully resolved the cited deficiencies and satisfied
the identified criteria communicated in the notification, the agency AO must take the following
actions:
