For a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design (HCD) and responsible for User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) of a web application, the following minimal list of actions must be taken to show compliance with FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Performance Management standards:

1. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure all UI elements meet Section 508 accessibility requirements.
2. **Usability Testing**: Conduct and document usability testing sessions with a sample of users.
3. **Security Notices**: Design clear, user-friendly notifications for security updates or vulnerabilities.
4. **Audit Trails**: Implement and clearly design logging features that capture user interactions, ensuring traceability.
5. **Incident Reporting UI**: Design a seamless and intuitive interface for users to report security incidents.
6. **Regular Updates**: Ensure the UI facilitates easy updates and patches to security features.
7. **Change Notifications**: Design clear, in-app notifications to inform users of significant changes or maintenance schedules.
8. **User Permissions**: Easily accessible sections to manage user roles and permissions within the application.
9. **Feedback Mechanism**: Integrate feedback loops for users to report issues or suggest improvements.
10. **Privacy Policy**: Ensure the privacy policy is prominently displayed and easily accessible from the application interface.

These actions will help demonstrate compliance with continuous monitoring and risk management requirements from the user's perspective.
