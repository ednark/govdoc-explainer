5. **Maintain a Vulnerability Baseline:** Establish and track a baseline for unique vulnerabilities.
6. **Remediate Vulnerabilities Promptly:** Ensure high-impact vulnerabilities are mitigated within defined timelines (e.g., 30 days).

### Reporting and Review
7. **Submit Timely Reports:** Arrange for the submission of monthly ConMon reports, including POA&M updates.
8. **Conduct Annual Assessments:** Complete and submit annual Security Assessment Plan (SAP) and Security Assessment Report (SAR) on time.
9. **Provide Incident Notifications:** Ensure timely reporting of incidents and critical vulnerabilities to FedRAMP.

### Change Management
