Sure, here's a minimal list of actions for a Designer focused on Human-Centered Design to ensure compliance with the government standards for a web application:

1. **Understand User Needs**: Conduct qualitative and quantitative research to map user journeys and understand user needs and pain points (Section 280.9 – Customer Understanding).

2. **Design Accessible UIs**: Ensure the application meets web accessibility standards to cater to diverse user groups, including those with disabilities (Section 280.6 – Multichannel Access).

3. **Simplify Processes**: Design interfaces and workflows to be easy to navigate and simple to use for all types of users (Section 280.3 – Ease/Simplicity).

4. **Ensure Efficiency**: Optimize the design for quick and efficient user interactions to minimize user burden and friction (Section 280.3 – Efficiency/Speed).

5. **Promote Transparency**: Incorporate clear, understandable instructions and feedback to users on their actions, ensuring transparency (Section 280.3 – Equity/Transparency).

6. **Engage in Iterative Testing**: Regularly involve users in testing and refining the design to ensure it meets their needs and expectations (Section 280.9 – Service Design and Improvement).

7. **Design for Multiple Channels**: Make sure the application is usable across various digital channels, including mobile devices, and that traditional channels are still available if needed (Section 280.7 – Digital Service Delivery).

8. **Collect User Feedback**: Implement mechanisms within the application to gather real-time user feedback and sentiment (Section 280.10 – Surveying Customer Experience).

9. **Role Definition and Collaboration**: Collaborate with other roles, such as developers and content writers, to ensure all elements of service delivery are aligned and coherent (Section 280.4 – Roles).

10. **Leverage Design Tools**: Use tools and technologies that support identity verification, mobile-responsiveness, and provide notifications to enhance user interactions (Section 280.4 – Tools).

These actions focus on the key aspects of designing user-centered web applications that comply with the specified government standards.
