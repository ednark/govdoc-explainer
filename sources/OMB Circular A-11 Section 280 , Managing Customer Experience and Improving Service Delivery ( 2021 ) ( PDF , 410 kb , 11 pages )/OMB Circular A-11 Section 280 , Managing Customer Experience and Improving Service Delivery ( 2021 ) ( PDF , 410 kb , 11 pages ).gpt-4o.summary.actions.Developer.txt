For a Developer specializing in Drupal who will implement backend business logic, here is the minimal list of actions to show compliance with the given government standards:

1. **User Identification:**
   - Implement user authentication and identity verification processes per government requirements.

2. **Digital Channels:**
   - Ensure the service is available through a digital channel (e.g., website, mobile).
   - Justify any services that are not digital and propose potential digital implementations.

3. **Human-Centered Design:**
   - Incorporate human-centered design principles in the backend workflows and interactions.
   - Ensure ease of use and intuitive navigation through backend logic.

4. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Integrate feedback collection mechanisms at various critical touchpoints.
   - Format feedback survey questions to collect trust scores, satisfaction levels, and experience driver metrics.

5. **Multi-Channel Support:**
   - Enable service delivery and transactions through multiple channels, ensuring support for non-digital methods when necessary.

6. **Data Management:**
   - Collect and store transaction data, customer feedback, and service metrics securely.
   - Ensure real-time or close-to-real-time data reporting mechanisms are in place.

7. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure backend business logic supports accessibility standards.

8. **Compliance Tracking:**
   - Implement mechanisms to track and log compliance with federal service delivery and customer experience standards.

9. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Maintain performance metrics (e.g., response times, success rates) to meet the standards.

10. **Security Measures:**
    - Implement robust security measures for data protection and ensure compliance with federal requirements.

By focusing on these areas, a Drupal developer can ensure that the backend logic of the application aligns with the relevant government standards on customer experience and service delivery.
