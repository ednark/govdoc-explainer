To effectively align your Drupal backend development with the requirements provided in Circular No. A-130 - "Managing Information as a Strategic Resource", you should focus on implementing the following key actions:

1. **Data Security Measures**: Implement and regularly update security protocols to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Use Drupalâ€™s modules such as Security Review and implement secure coding practices.

2. **Data Privacy Compliance**: Adhere to federal privacy laws and regulations by integrating privacy settings into user interfaces, ensuring data anonymization where necessary, and providing users with access controls.

3. **Information Lifecycle Management**: Develop features in the backend that manage data from creation, processing, dissemination, usage, storage, and disposal according to government-prescribed data lifecycle guidelines.

4. **Use of Open Standards**: Ensure that any new implementations support interoperability by using open standards. Evaluate and integrate compatible Drupal modules that promote data exchange and system integration.

5. **Transparent Data Documentation**: Clearly document all data processes and modifications in your backend implementations, including data sourcing, handling procedures, and any changes to existing data structures.

6. **Efficient Data Management Systems**: Design and implement efficient data querying and indexing mechanisms to ensure timely and accurate information retrieval, which supports the decision-making process defined by the government standards.

7. **Regular Auditing and Reporting**: Set up mechanisms within your development cycle to regularly audit data use and application performance against the government standards. Prepare to generate reports that demonstrate compliance and efficient management of information resources.

By focusing on these critical areas, you can ensure your web applications not only comply with the governmental standards from Circular No. A-130 but also support the strategic management of information resources.
