Certainly! Here is a minimal list of actions a Designer, specializing in Human Centered Design, must take to show compliance with Circular No. A-130's standards from a User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) perspective:

1. **User Needs Analysis:**
   - Conduct and document user needs assessments, including interviews and surveys.
  
2. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act for digital accessibility.
   - Incorporate WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards into design.

3. **Privacy Protection:**

   - Ensure that privacy notices and consent forms are clearly visible and understandable.

4. **Information Quality:**
   - Design interfaces that present data accurately and understandably.
   - Simplify complex information through visuals and intuitive layouts.

5. **Security Awareness:**
   - Incorporate security messaging and warnings relevant to user activities.
   - Use design to guide users towards secure behaviors (e.g., strong password creation).

6. **User Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Design easy-to-use feedback forms and survey mechanisms for continuous user input.
   - Ensure feedback systems are accessible and user-friendly.

7. **Data Transparency:**
   - Design interfaces that clearly display how user data will be used and stored.
   - Provide easy-to-navigate settings for users to control their data privacy.
