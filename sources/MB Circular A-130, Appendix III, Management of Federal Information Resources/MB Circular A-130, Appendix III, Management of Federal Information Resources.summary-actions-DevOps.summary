To ensure that a web application complies with Circular No. A-130 - Managing Information as a Strategic Resource from the perspective of a DevOps technician, the following actions should be taken:

1. **Secure Information Management**: Implement robust security practices ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. This includes encryption, secure access controls, and regular security audits.

2. **Data Governance**: Establish clear policies and procedures for data management, adhering to federal standards for data quality, accessibility, and lifecycle management.

3. **Interoperability and Standards Compliance**: Design and configure systems to be interoperable with other government systems and compliant with federal IT standards. This includes using approved protocols, data formats, and interfaces.

4. **Disaster Recovery and Continuity Planning**: Create and maintain a disaster recovery plan that ensures the ability to operate and recover IT operations in case of disruption. Plan must align with continuity requirements of government operations.

5. **Performance and Scalability**: Ensure that the infrastructure can handle specified loads and performance benchmarks as outlined in government criteria, with scalable resources to meet future demands.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Reporting**: Implement systems for ongoing monitoring of the IT environment to identify and respond to threats, performance bottlenecks, or non-compliance issues, and to generate compliance reports as required.

7. **Documentation and Reporting Compliance**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of all systems, processes, and compliances, and ensure that compliance reports are created and submitted in accordance with government requirements.

These actions, when properly documented and implemented, demonstrate compliance with Circular No. A-130, optimizing the strategic management of information in government-related projects.
