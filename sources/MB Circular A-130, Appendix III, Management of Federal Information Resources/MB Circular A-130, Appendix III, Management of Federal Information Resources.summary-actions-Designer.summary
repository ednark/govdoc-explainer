To comply with the Government Standards Document Circular No. A-130, focusing on managing information as a strategic resource from the perspective of a designer specializing in Human-Centered Design, consider the following key actions:

1. **User-Centric Design Focus**: Ensure that the design process centers around user needs and behaviors. Gather and utilize user research to understand the target audience deeply.

2. **Accessibility Compliance**: Adhere to the accessibility standards to make the web application usable by all people, including those with disabilities. Implementing guidelines from WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is typically a requirement.

3. **Clear Information Presentation**: Design interfaces that clearly present information, ensuring data is easy to find, understand, and use. Navigation should be intuitive and content should be organized logically.

4. **Privacy and Security**: Integrate privacy and security considerations from the beginning of the design process. Ensure that user data collection and storage meet government regulations on data privacy and security.

5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement user feedback mechanisms to continually improve the application based on user input. This aligns with the government's focus on iterative development and continuous improvement.

6. **Testing for Usability**: Conduct regular usability testing to ensure the application meets user needs and is easy to use. Use results to refine and improve the user interface and experience.

7. **Documentation and Transparency**: Maintain clear records of design decisions, user research findings, testing results, and modifications made based on feedback. This documentation demonstrates compliance and informs future improvements.

Focusing on these actions will help ensure the web applications you design are in compliance with the policies outlined in Circular No. A-130, focusing on managing information as a strategic resource for government projects.
