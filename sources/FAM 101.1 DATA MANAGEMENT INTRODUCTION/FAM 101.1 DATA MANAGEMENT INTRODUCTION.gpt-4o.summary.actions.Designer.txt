As a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design, responsible for the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) of the application, here are the minimal actions required to ensure compliance with government standards:

1. **Incorporate Accessibility Features:**
   - Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen readers, keyboard navigation). Follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

2. **Apply Data Privacy Principles:**
   - Design interfaces that minimize data collection to the essential information needed.
   - Ensure that any user data collected is clearly communicated to the user, and consent is obtained.

3. **Enable Transparency:**
   - Provide users with clear, easy-to-find information on how their data will be used (e.g., privacy policy, data usage notice).

4. **Enhance Data Security Practices:**
   - Implement secure design principles (e.g., secure input fields, encrypted communication).

5. **Facilitate Data Sharing with Lower Risks:**
   - Design interfaces that allow secure, controlled sharing of data, ensuring that users understand and consent to what data is shared and with whom.

6. **Ensure Interoperability:**
   - Ensure that the design supports data standards and formats that facilitate interoperability with other systems.

7. **Promote Data Quality and Integrity:**
   - Design interfaces that validate data entry to ensure accuracy and completeness of user-provided information.

8. **Adopt Open and Machine-Readable Formats:**
   - Where applicable, ensure that publicly available data is provided in open and machine-readable formats per government open data policies.

By implementing these actions, you will ensure that the UX/UI design of the web application complies with the essential government standards relevant to data management, privacy, security, and accessibility.
