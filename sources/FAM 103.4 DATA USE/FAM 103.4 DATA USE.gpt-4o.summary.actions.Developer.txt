   - Prevent repurposing data without necessary approvals.

3. **Access Guidance for Data Use**:
   - Provide clear in-application guidance or contact information regarding data use restrictions.

4. **Audit and Logging Mechanisms**:
   - Install and configure modules for logging data usage.
   - Regularly schedule and perform audits to ensure usage complies with the agreed purposes.
