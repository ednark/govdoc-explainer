Here's a minimal list of actions a Designer should take on a project to show compliance with the government data use standards:

1. **Clarify Data Purpose**: Ensure the purpose of data use is clearly communicated in the UI, referencing the MOU or DSA where necessary.
   
2. **Source Indication**: Display the source of authoritative data within the user interface, ensuring users know it is reliable.

3. **Contact Information**: Integrate straightforward, easily accessible contact information for users to get guidance on data usage.

4. **Compliance Notices**: Include notices or reminders within the UI regarding the appropriate and approved use of data to promote regular awareness.

5. **Audit Prompts**: Design features that facilitate regular checks and auditing of data usage by users.

By following these steps, designers can ensure their work contributes to the project's compliance with data use standards.
