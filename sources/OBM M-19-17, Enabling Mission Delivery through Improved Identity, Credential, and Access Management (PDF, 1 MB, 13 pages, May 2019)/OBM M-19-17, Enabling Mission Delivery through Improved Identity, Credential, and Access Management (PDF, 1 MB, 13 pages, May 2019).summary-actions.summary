To ensure compliance with government standards for a web application according to the Government Standards Document, you should take the following actions:

1. **Identity Proofing Alignment**: Implement identity verification methods compliant with NIST SP 800-63 guidelines to ensure the secure and accurate verification of user identities accessing your web application.

2. **PII Collection Limitation**: Ensure that personally identifiable information (PII) collection aligns with legal authorization. Collect only relevant and necessary information for identity proofing and ensure it is protected in accordance with the risk associated with the data.

3. **Digital Identity Risk Management**: Integrate digital identity risk management practices as specified in NIST SP 800-63. Tailor the assurance levels to align with the specific risk profile of your service offerings.

4. **Credential Management**: Facilitate the management of credentials, considering lifecycle requirements such as binding, renewing, revoking, and securely destroying credentials as outlined by NIST standards and federal requirements.

5. **Access Control Mechanisms**: Deploy robust access control structures by requiring PIV credentials or acceptable alternatives for authentication. Manage access permissions diligently to prevent unauthorized access and promptly revoke access when no longer appropriate.

6. **API Security and Integration**: Ensure APIs used in the web application are secure and facilitate interoperability across government systems. Ensure API security measures are in line with federal guidelines and provide validated attribute data as necessary.

7. **Compliance with FIPS 201**: For employees and contractors requiring access to federally controlled information systems, ensure FIPS 201 standards are met, which govern Personal Identity Verification (PIV).

8. **Adoption of Federated Identity Solutions**: Implement federated identity structures that allow users to authenticate across different government systems securely, in compliance with the federated identity guidelines prescribed by the government.

9. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Use**: Leverage PKI technologies for secure communication, ensuring that digital certificates are used as per the guidelines to authenticate and secure data transitions.

10. **Privacy and Security Assurance**: Regularly review and update protocols to protect user privacy and application security, meeting or exceeding government-established cyber security standards.

11. **Federal ICAM Architecture Compliance**: Align the web applicationâ€™s identity, credential, and access management strategies with the Federal ICAM architecture to ensure compliance and interoperability across federal systems.

By adhering to these nurturing steps, your web application can comply with the established government guidelines, ensuring robust identity management, privacy, and cybersecurity measures.
