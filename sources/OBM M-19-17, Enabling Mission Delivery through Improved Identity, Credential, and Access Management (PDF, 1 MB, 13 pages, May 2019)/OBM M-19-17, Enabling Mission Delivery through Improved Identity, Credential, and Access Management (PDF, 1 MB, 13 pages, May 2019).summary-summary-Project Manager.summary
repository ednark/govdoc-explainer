Certainly! Hereâ€™s a streamlined summary of primary standards, guidelines, and requirements, with a focus on aspects particularly relevant to security, accessibility, user experience, and compliance:

### Primary Standards and Guidelines:
1. **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3**: This is the foundational document for digital identity services, guiding the implementation of identity proofing, credentialing, and access management.

2. **Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12)**: It remains the government-wide policy for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal employees and contractors.

3. **Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2**: Standard for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, emphasizing the lifecycle of identities over credentials.

4. **Derived PIV Credentials**: Mentioned for enabling the acceptance of Derived PIV Credentials by applications and devices.

### Sections Focused on Security, Accessibility, User Experience, and Compliance:
- **Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM)**: Ensures secure and efficient government operations through proper identification, credentialing, and access management.
- **Shifting the Operating Model beyond the Perimeter**: Emphasizes on using identity as the foundation for security rather than perimeter defense only.
- **Improving Digital Interactions with the American Public**: Centers on minimizing PII collection, enhancing data protection, and ensuring user convenience and security in digital interactions.
- **Government-wide Responsibilities**: Outlines specific duties assigned to departments such as DOC, GSA, OPM, and DHS to enforce and innovate upon guidelines for identity and access management.

### Simplified Summary:
- **NIST SP 800-63-3, HSPD-12, and FIPS 201-2** are key documents setting the standards for identity proofing, credentialing, and access management.
- **Security** is highlighted through ICAM and a shift beyond perimeter defense, focusing on identity management.
- **Accessibility and User Experience** improvements are noted in reducing PII collection and simplifying public interactions with digital services.
- **Compliance** is enforced via government-wide responsibilities ensuring adherence to and development of ICAM standards and practices. 

This summary is created to assist in keeping track of project-level requirements and ensuring that all implementations align with government standards regarding security, accessibility, user experience, and compliance.
