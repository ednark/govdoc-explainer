To ensure compliance with the Government Standards Document ICAM (Identity, Credential, and Access Management) for a web application from a DevOps perspective, consider the following key action points:

1. **Implement ICAM Infrastructure**: Set up and maintain an infrastructure that supports effective Identity, Credential, and Access Management, adhering to the guidelines in NIST SP 800-63 and other related publications.

2. **Deploy PIV-Compliant Access Control**: Ensure that Physical and Logical Access Controls comply with Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standards specified in FIPS 201-2. This includes using PIV credentials for authentication to Federal information systems and controlled facilities.

3. **Adopt Derived PIV Credentials**: Where applicable, utilize Derived PIV Credentials for access management in mobile and other devices as mandated by OPM and NIST SP 800-157 guidelines.

4. **Ensure Identity Proofing Aligns with NIST Guidance**: For public-facing services, align identity proofing processes with NIST SP 800-63 to minimize risks associated with digital interactions. This involves limiting the collection and use of PII, ensuring it is protected in accordance with its risk level.

5. **Use Federated Identity Solutions**: Promote the use of federated identity solutions that allow for the acceptance and validation of existing, verified PIV credentials across government agencies. This assists in achieving inter-agency interoperability and access management.

6. **Continuously Update Security Measures**: Regularly update and patch systems to align with the latest security standards and guidelines. Engage in continuous monitoring and vulnerability assessments to address emerging threats efficiently.

7. **Implement Privacy-Enhanced Data Validation**: For agencies authoritative in certain identity data (e.g., SSN), establish APIs that allow for privacy-protected data validation, used by both public and private identity proofing services.

8. **Leverage Commercial Standards and APIs**: Ensure that the deployed ICAM capabilities are interoperable and based on commercially available products and open APIs, promoting a modular and flexible infrastructure that can adapt to evolving needs.

9. **Adhere to Governance and Compliance Requirements**: Establish an integrated governance structure to enforce and manage ICAM efforts across the organization. This includes aligning with the Federal CIO Councilâ€™s guidelines for agency-wide ICAM policies and technologies.

10. **Document and Report Compliance**: Maintain detailed documentation of all processes, policies, and controls implemented for ICAM. Regularly review and report these measures to the OMB and relevant authorities to demonstrate ongoing compliance and operational effectiveness.

By focusing on these areas, a DevOps technician can establish a robust framework to ensure a web application meets the necessary government standards for identity and access management, enhancing overall security and compliance.
