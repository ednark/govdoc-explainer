## **Document Summary for Drupal Developer: Standards and Guidelines Implementation**

### **Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements:**
1. **NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3:** The main standard to follow for digital identity. This sets the guidelines for the creation of digital identities, identity proofing, and using federation and credentials. Helps in implementation compliant with modern security and privacy expectations.

2. **Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2**: This outlines the requirements for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors; it governs the physical and logical access to Federal systems.

3. **Derived PIV Credentials**: Mentioned in NIST SP 800-157, it is required for secure, reliable access to federal systems and aligns with mobile and cloud technology needs.

4. **OMB Circular A-130**: Pertains to managing information as a strategic resource, including privacy requirements particularly around Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

5. **Accessibility and Usage of Federally Approved Credentials**: Emphasizes on accepting and using PIV credentials and Derived PIV Credentials for secure access to federal systems and facilities.

### **Specific Focus Areas:**
- **Security**: Requirements from NIST SP 800-63-3 and FIPS 201 for digital identity risk management and assurance levels to secure the access and management of federal resources.
- **User Experience**: Emphasized on leveraging existing credentials and reducing the necessity for multiple identities, enhancing user interaction with federal digital services.
- **Compliance**: Mandates adherence to various standards such as FIPS 201 and the guidance of NIST SP 800-63-3 for ensuring compliance with federal guidelines on identity proofing and management.
- **Accessibility**: Follow guidelines that ensure users can bind, update, use, and disassociate their non-government authenticators to their digital identities seamlessly.

### **Simplified Summary:**
- **Implement NIST SP 800-63-3 and FIPS 201-2 guidelines** to set up secure digital identity management and personal identity verification.
- **Ensure compliance with federal access and security protocols**, including adhering to requirements for PIV credentials and Derived PIV Credentials.
- **Focus on enhancing user experience** by facilitating easy management and interaction with digital identities.
- **Adopt enhanced security measures** to safeguard Personally Identifiable Information and comply with privacy standards set forth in OMB Circular A-130.

By adhering to these summarized pointers, you, as a Drupal developer, can ensure the backend logic aligns well with compliance, security, user experience, and accessibility requirements as outlined in the government standards document.
