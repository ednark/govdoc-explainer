To ensure compliance with the standards as a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design for web applications, focus on the following minimal list of actions:

1. **Identity Proofing and User Authentication Design**: Incorporate design elements that support strong identity verification and authentication processes. This includes ensuring the user interface facilitates easy input and understanding of information required for identity proofing and using authentication methods such as PIV (Personal Identity Verification) credentials.

2. **Accessible and Secure Transactions**: Design interfaces that ensure secure and accessible transactions for all users. This includes implementing encrypted data transmissions and secure storage of personally identifiable information (PII) while maintaining usability.

3. **Design for Federated Identity Management**: Develop user interface components that support federated identity management, allowing users to use PIV credentials issued by other agencies or trusted entities. Ensure that these systems are compatible and can seamlessly integrate such credentials.

4. **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies Implementation**: Integrate privacy-enhancing technologies into the design. Focus on minimal and relevant data collection, ensuring that data collection points in the user interface are clear about what data is collected and why.

5. **User Consent and Control Mechanisms**: Design clear and intuitive mechanisms for user control over their data, including consent elements where users can agree or object to the processing and sharing of their personal information as per the Privacy Act.

6. **Responsive and Inclusive Design**: Ensure that the applicationâ€™s design is responsive and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Follow the latest accessibility guidelines to accommodate a broad user base.

7. **Interoperability and Standards Compliance**: Check and ensure that all design components adhere to open standards and can interact effectively with other government systems and services. Use commercially available products and APIs that promote interoperability.

8. **Regular User Feedback Integration**: Establish mechanisms within the design to capture user feedback continuously. Use this feedback to iterate on and improve the authentication and identity proofing components.

9. **Security Features Visibility**: Make security features visible and understandable to the users without compromising the overall user experience. This includes clear indicators of secure connections, encryption use, and the secure handling of their personal data.

10. **Education and Information**: Design educational materials that are integrated into the application to inform users about the security and privacy features of the application, how their data will be used, and how they are being protected. 

Each of these actions not only aids in compliance but enhances the overall user experience, encouraging users to trust and effectively interact with the government web applications.
