### Document Summary for DevOps Technician

#### Primary Standards and Requirements
1. **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3**:
   - Foundation for digital identity across federal agencies.
   - Focus on identity proofing, authentication, and access management.
   - Adopt a risk management perspective for digital identity.
   - Utilize alongside other related NIST publications.

2. **Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2**:
   - Standard for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) for Federal employees and contractors.
   - Emphasizes identity verification and credential management.

3. **Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12)**:
   - Government-wide policy for secure and reliable identification for Federal employees and contractors.
   - Agencies to issue, suspend, and revoke PIV credentials.

#### Focus Areas Relevant for DevOps

**Security and Compliance**:
- Implement robust processes for authentication, access management, and the lifecycle of identities.
- Ensure systems and procedures comply with NIST SP 800-63 for digital identities and FIPS 201-2 for PIV credentialing.

**Accessibility and User Experience**:
- Manage secure access to Federal information systems and facilities.
- Use Derived PIV Credentials to enable seamless authentication across devices and applications.

#### Key Elements Shortened
- **NIST SP 800-63-3**: Core guideline for managing digital identities with a risk-based approach.
- **FIPS 201-2**: Mandatory standard for verifying Federal employee and contractor identities.
- **HSPD-12**: Requires PIV credentials for secure authentication and access within Federal facilities and systems.
- **Security Implementation**: Ensure systems align with NIST and FIPS guidelines for security and identity management.
- **User Access Management**: Deploy Derived PIV Credentials for broad and secure system access.

This summary captures the essential standards and guidelines from the document, focusing on security, compliance, and the implementation of efficient user authentication and access systems, which are crucial from a Devops perspective.
