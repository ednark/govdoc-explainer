To ensure compliance with the outlined government standards in the development and management of a web application, consider the following key actions:

1. **Identity Proofing and Credentialing**: Implement and maintain a secure system for identity proofing and credentialing of users as detailed in NIST SP 800-63. Ensure methods align with acceptable risk levels concerning the access to Federal information systems.

2. **PIV Credentials Usage**: Establish and enforce the use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials for accessing both the physical and digital resources of the Federal system, in line with OPM requirements and NIST guidelines.

3. **Derived PIV Credential Implementation**: Enhance mobile and remote access by adopting Derived PIV Credentials, ensuring they meet security and interoperability standards as per NIST guidance and FIPS requirements.

4. **Access Control Management**: Develop robust mechanisms for managing, monitoring, and restricting user access based on authorization level, including procedures for timely revocation of PIV credentials and access rights.

5. **Interoperability and Federation**: Support identity federation and interoperability across different agencies and systems by accepting and verifying PIV identity assertions from other agencies for access to federally controlled facilities and information systems.

6. **Continuous Vetting**: Implement continuous vetting mechanisms as part of the identity management lifecycle to adapt to the evolving risk landscape and maintain alignment with HSPD-12 goals.

7. **Enhance ICAM Capabilities**: Develop an integrated agency-wide ICAM governance structure tasked with the enforcement of ICAM policies and the management of associated technologies across the enterprise.

8. **Digital Identity Risk Management**: Incorporate Digital Identity Risk Management into existing processes, selecting assurance levels that match the risk profile of digital services in accordance with NIST SP 800-63.

9. **Responsive Architecture and Acquisition Standards**: Rationalize ICAM capabilities to be interchangeable, leveraging commercially available products and open APIs. Ensure that acquisition of services and products complies with OMB policy, NIST standards, and applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations.

10. **Privacy and Data Protection**: Limit the collection of personally identifiable information (PII) to what is necessary and ensure its protection in line with the risk it presents. Assess and revise data protection measures regularly to address emerging threats.

11. **Feedback and Continuous Improvement**: Solicit and utilize feedback from both internal stakeholders and external users to continuously improve ICAM services, in line with evolving Federal standards and guidelines.

Each of these actions should be mapped to specific milestones within the project timeline, regularly reviewed, and documented to ensure ongoing compliance and accountability throughout the web application lifecycle.
