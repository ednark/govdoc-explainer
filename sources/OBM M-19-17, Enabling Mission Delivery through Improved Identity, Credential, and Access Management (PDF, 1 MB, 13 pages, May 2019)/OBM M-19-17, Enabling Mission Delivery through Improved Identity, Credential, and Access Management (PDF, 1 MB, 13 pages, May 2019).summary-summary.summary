**Summary of Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements**

1. **Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM)**
   - ICAM is essential for secure and efficient government operations. It enables accurate management of identities, credentials, and access for people and resources engaged in Federal Government transactions.

2. **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63**
   - Agencies must implement this standard, which guides digital identity assertions, essential for accessing physical and digital resources securely.

3. **Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12)**
   - Remains the government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification. It mandates the use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials for federal employees and contractors.

4. **Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2**
   - Governs the PIV process, ensuring a standardized method of identity proofing and credential issuance.

5. **Risk Management**
   - Emphasized across several sections, including shifting operational models beyond perimeter defense and incorporating risk management in identity functions.

6. **Privacy Protection Measures**
   - Mandates limiting the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and implementing robust practices to protect it.

7. **Interoperability and Technology Adoption**
   - Agencies are encouraged to use commercially available products, open APIs, and standard protocols to enhance interoperability and modernize technology stacks.

8. **Government-wide ICAM Architecture and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Requirements**
   - Agencies are required to adhere to these frameworks to enhance cybersecurity and risk management postures.

**Focus on Security, Accessibility, User Experience, and Compliance:**

- **Security:** NIST SP 800-63, FIPS 201-2, and enhanced risk management practices (such as continuous vetting and PIV credentials) are crucial for securing Federal resources.
- **Accessibility:** Mandates use of open APIs and standard protocols to ensure systems are interoperable and accessible across government agencies.
- **User Experience:** Emphasizes the need for using PIV credentials and derived credentials to simplify and secure access to Federal systems and facilities.
- **Compliance:** Directs adherence to Federal laws, OMB policies, and standards like HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 to ensure consistent and comprehensive implementation across agencies.

**Condensed Summary:**
The document sets forth essential guidelines for Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM), incorporating standards like NIST SP 800-63 and FIPS 201-2 to enhance the security and efficiency of government operations. It stresses the significant role of HSPD-12 in maintaining a standardized governmental identification system. Key to these efforts are robust risk management, adherence to privacy standards, seamless technology integration for user accessibility, and strict compliance with established federal guidelines.
