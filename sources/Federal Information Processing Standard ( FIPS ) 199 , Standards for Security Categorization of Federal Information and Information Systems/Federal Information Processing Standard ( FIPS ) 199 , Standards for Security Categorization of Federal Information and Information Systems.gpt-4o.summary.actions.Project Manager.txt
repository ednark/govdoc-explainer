Certainly! Hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions a project manager should take to ensure compliance with FIPS PUB 199 standards for a web application project:

1. **Identify Information Types:** 
   Determine the specific categories of information the web application will handle (e.g., privacy, financial, medical).

2. **Classify Security Objectives:**
   Assess the potential impact levels (LOW, MODERATE, HIGH) for confidentiality, integrity, and availability for each information type.

3. **Document Security Categories:**
   Create formal documentation detailing the security categories for each type of information the application will handle.

4. **Select Security Controls:**
   Choose appropriate management, operational, and technical controls based on the highest determined impact levels for the system (the "high water mark").

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   Conduct a risk assessment that integrates vulnerability and threat information related to the categorized information.

6. **Client Coordination:**
   Discuss and verify these security requirements with the client, ensuring they understand the importance and implications of each categorization and control.

7. **Implement Security Measures:**
   Ensure the development team implements the selected security controls according to the documented requirements.

8. **Create Compliance Documentation:**
   Maintain comprehensive records of all categorizations, controls, and assessments for audit purposes.

9. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   Establish a plan for continuous monitoring of the implemented security controls to ensure ongoing compliance and to address any new threats or vulnerabilities.

10. **Review and Update:**
   Periodically review and update the security categorization and controls to adapt to changes in the information types or project scope.

By focusing on these actions, the project manager can effectively track and guide the project towards compliance with FIPS PUB 199 standards.
