Here are the minimal actions a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design needs to take to ensure compliance with FIPS PUB 199 standards:

1. **Understand User Data Sensitivity**: Identify and categorize the types of user data (public, sensitive, confidential) based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.

2. **User Authentication Practices**: Design interfaces that support strong user authentication measures, such as multi-factor authentication.

3. **Access Control**: Create user role interfaces to ensure access levels align with confidentiality requirements, restricting sensitive information to authorized users only.

4. **Secure Data Transmission**: Ensure the design incorporates secure data transmission methods, such as using HTTPS for all data exchanges.

5. **Data Input Validation**: Implement user input validation techniques to prevent unauthorized data modification, which supports data integrity.

6. **Session Management**: Design secure session management interfaces (e.g., timeouts, secure session handling) to maintain availability and confidentiality.

7. **Error Messages**: Craft error messages that do not disclose sensitive information which can maintain confidentiality and prevent security breaches.

8. **Regular Auditing**: Include features for regular user activity tracking and auditing within the interface to help in monitoring and maintaining data integrity and availability.

9. **User Education**: Integrate user education prompts or help sections on security best practices within the UI to enhance user awareness.

10. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure that the application meets accessibility standards which also support secure and reliable user access, maintaining data availability.

By focusing on these actions, the Designer can ensure that the web application is aligned with FIPS PUB 199 standards from a user interface and user experience perspective.
