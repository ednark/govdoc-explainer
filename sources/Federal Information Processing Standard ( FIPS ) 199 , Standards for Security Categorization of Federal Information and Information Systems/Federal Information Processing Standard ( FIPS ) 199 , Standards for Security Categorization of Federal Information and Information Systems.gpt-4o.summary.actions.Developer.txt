Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise list of actions that a Drupal developer should take to ensure compliance with FIPS PUB 199 standards on a web application:

1. **Implement Authentication:**
   - Utilize secure login mechanisms.
   - Ensure strong password policies.

2. **Ensure Data Confidentiality:**
   - Use encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit (e.g., HTTPS, encrypted databases).
   - Apply permissions to restrict data access to authorized users only.

3. **Maintain Data Integrity:**
   - Use checksums or hash functions to verify data integrity.
   - Implement validation checks to prevent unauthorized or incorrect data modifications.
   
4. **Ensure Data Availability:**
   - Set up reliable hosting with redundancy and failover systems.
   - Implement regular backups and test restoration procedures.

5. **Log and Monitor Activities:**
   - Enable logging for access and modification events.
   - Monitor logs for any suspicious activities.

6. **Access Controls:**
   - Set up role-based access controls (RBAC) to limit user permissions based on roles.
   - Periodically review and update access permissions.

7. **Secure Configuration Management:**
   - Regularly update Drupal core and modules to address security vulnerabilities.
   - Follow best practices for secure Drupal configuration (e.g., disable unnecessary modules).

8. **Implement Audit Mechanisms:**
   - Set up mechanisms to track and log user activities and configuration changes.
   - Regularly review audit logs for compliance and security issues.

9. **Data Sanitization:**
   - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
   - Use Drupal API functions for secure data handling.

10. **Secure API Integrations:**
    - Ensure all API endpoints are secured with appropriate authentication and authorization checks.
    - Use encrypted channels for API communications.

These actions help the developer to configure and implement the necessary backend business logic while staying compliant with the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability as outlined in FIPS PUB 199.
