FOREWORD 
The Federal Information Processing Standards Publication Series of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) is the official series of publications relating to standards and 
guidelines adopted and promulgated under the provisions of Section 5131 of the Information 
Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106) and the Federal Information 
Security Management Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347). These mandates have given the Secretary 
of Commerce and NIST important responsibilities for improving the utilization and management of 
computer and related telecommunications systems in the federal government. The NIST, through its 
Information Technology Laboratory, provides leadership, technical guidance, and coordination of 
government efforts in the development of standards and guidelines in these areas. Comments concerning Federal Information Processing Standards Publications are welcomed and

1     PURPOSE 
The E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347), passed by the one hundred and seventh 
Congress and signed into law by the President in December 2002, recognized the importance of 
information security to the economic and national security interests of the United States. Title III of 
the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), 
tasked NIST with responsibilities for standards and guidelines, including the development of: 
• 
Standards to be used by all federal agencies to categorize all information and information systems 
collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives of providing 
appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels; 
• 
Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be included in 
each category; and 
• 
Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and technical 
controls), for information and information systems in each such category. FIPS Publication 199 addresses the first task cited—to develop standards for categorizing information 
and information systems. Security categorization standards for information and information systems 
provide a common framework and understanding for expressing security that, for the federal 
government, promotes: (i) effective management and oversight of information security programs, 
including the coordination of information security efforts throughout the civilian, national security, 
emergency preparedness, homeland security, and law enforcement communities; and (ii) consistent 
reporting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress on the adequacy and 
effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, and practices.</div><div id="chunk-1" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Subsequent NIST standards 
and guidelines will address the second and third tasks cited. 2    APPLICABILITY 
These standards shall apply to: (i) all information within the federal government other than that 
information that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12958, as amended by Executive 
Order 13292, or any predecessor order, or by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to require 
protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status; and (ii) all 
federal information systems other than those information systems designated as national security 
systems as defined in 44 United States Code Section 3542(b)(2). Agency officials shall use the 
security categorizations described in FIPS Publication 199 whenever there is a federal requirement to 
provide such a categorization of information or information systems. Additional security designators 
may be developed and used at agency discretion. State, local, and tribal governments as well as 
private sector organizations comprising the critical infrastructure of the United States may consider 
the use of these standards as appropriate. These standards are effective upon approval by the 
Secretary of Commerce. 3     CATEGORIZATION OF INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
This publication establishes security categories for both information1 and information systems. The 
security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events occur 
which jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to accomplish 
its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day 
functions, and protect individuals. Security categories are to be used in conjunction with vulnerability 
and threat information in assessing the risk to an organization. 1 Information is categorized according to its information type.</div><div id="chunk-2" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> An information type is a specific category of information 
(e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security management) defined by an 
organization or, in some instances, by a specific law, Executive Order, directive, policy, or regulation. 1

________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Security Objectives 
The FISMA defines three security objectives for information and information systems: 
CONFIDENTIALITY 
“Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for 
protecting personal privacy and proprietary information…” [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542] 
A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information. INTEGRITY 
“Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring 
information non-repudiation and authenticity…” [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542] 
A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information. AVAILABILITY 
“Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information…” [44 U.S.C., SEC. 3542] 
A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an information system. Potential Impact on Organizations and Individuals 
FIPS Publication 199 defines three levels of potential impact on organizations or individuals should 
there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). The application 
of these definitions must take place within the context of each organization and the overall national 
interest. The potential impact is LOW if— 
−  The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse 
effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.2 
AMPLIFICATION: A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration 
that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is 
noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial 
loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals. The potential impact is MODERATE if— 
−  The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse 
effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.</div><div id="chunk-3" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> AMPLIFICATION: A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent 
and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the 
functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result 
in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss 
of life or serious life threatening injuries. 2 Adverse effects on individuals may include, but are not limited to, loss of the privacy to which individuals are entitled 
under law. 2  
FIPS Publication 199                       Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
The potential impact is HIGH if— 
−  The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or 
catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. AMPLIFICATION: A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission 
capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its 
primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial 
loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life 
threatening injuries. Security Categorization Applied to Information Types 
The security category of an information type can be associated with both user information and system 
information3 and can be applicable to information in either electronic or non-electronic form. It can 
also be used as input in considering the appropriate security category of an information system (see 
description of security categories for information systems below). Establishing an appropriate 
security category of an information type essentially requires determining the potential impact for each 
security objective associated with the particular information type. The generalized format for expressing the security category, SC, of an information type is: 
SC information type = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}, 
where the acceptable values for potential impact are LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, or NOT APPLICABLE.4 
EXAMPLE 1: An organization managing public information on its web server determines that there is 
no potential impact from a loss of confidentiality (i.e., confidentiality requirements are not applicable), 
a moderate potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a moderate potential impact from a loss of 
availability. The resulting security category, SC, of this information type is expressed as: 
SC public information = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, MODERATE)}. EXAMPLE 2: A law enforcement organization managing extremely sensitive investigative information 
determines that the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is high, the potential impact from a 
loss of integrity is moderate, and the potential impact from a loss of availability is moderate. The 
resulting security category, SC, of this information type is expressed as: 
SC investigative information = {(confidentiality, HIGH), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, MODERATE)}.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> EXAMPLE 3: A financial organization managing routine administrative information (not privacy-related 
information) determines that the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is low, the potential 
impact from a loss of integrity is low, and the potential impact from a loss of availability is low. The 
resulting security category, SC, of this information type is expressed as: 
SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}. 3 System information (e.g., network routing tables, password files, and cryptographic key management information) 
must be protected at a level commensurate with the most critical or sensitive user information being processed, stored, 
or transmitted by the information system to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 4 The potential impact value of not applicable only applies to the security objective of confidentiality. 3  
FIPS Publication 199                       Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Security Categorization Applied to Information Systems 
Determining the security category of an information system requires slightly more analysis and must 
consider the security categories of all information types resident on the information system. For an 
information system, the potential impact values assigned to the respective security objectives 
(confidentiality, integrity, availability) shall be the highest values (i.e., high water mark) from among 
those security categories that have been determined for each type of information resident on the 
information system.5 
The generalized format for expressing the security category, SC, of an information system is: 
SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}, 
where the acceptable values for potential impact are LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH. Note that the value of not applicable cannot be assigned to any security objective in the context of 
establishing a security category for an information system. This is in recognition that there is a low 
minimum potential impact (i.e., low water mark) on the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability for an information system due to the fundamental requirement to protect the system-level 
processing functions and information critical to the operation of the information system. EXAMPLE 4: An information system used for large acquisitions in a contracting organization contains 
both sensitive, pre-solicitation phase contract information and routine administrative information. The 
management within the contracting organization determines that: (i) for the sensitive contract 
information, the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is moderate, the potential impact from 
a loss of integrity is moderate, and the potential impact from a loss of availability is low; and (ii) for 
the routine administrative information (non-privacy-related information), the potential impact from a 
loss of confidentiality is low, the potential impact from a loss of integrity is low, and the potential 
impact from a loss of availability is low. The resulting security categories, SC, of these information 
types are expressed as: 
SC contract information = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, LOW)}, 
and 
SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}. The resulting security category of the information system is expressed as: 
SC acquisition system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, LOW)},  
representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective from 
the information types resident on the acquisition system.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> 5 It is recognized that information systems are composed of both programs and information. Programs in execution 
within an information system (i.e., system processes) facilitate the processing, storage, and transmission of information 
and are necessary for the organization to conduct its essential mission-related functions and operations. These system 
processing functions also require protection and could be subject to security categorization as well. However, in the 
interest of simplification, it is assumed that the security categorization of all information types associated with the 
information system provide an appropriate worst case potential impact for the overall information system—thereby 
obviating the need to consider the system processes in the security categorization of the information system. 4

EXAMPLE 5: A power plant contains a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system 
controlling the distribution of electric power for a large military installation. The SCADA system 
contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative information. The management at the 
power plant determines that: (i) for the sensor data being acquired by the SCADA system, there is no 
potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a high potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a 
high potential impact from a loss of availability; and (ii) for the administrative information being 
processed by the system, there is a low potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a low potential 
impact from a loss of integrity, and a low potential impact from a loss of availability. The resulting 
security categories, SC, of these information types are expressed as: 
SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}, 
and 
SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}. The resulting security category of the information system is initially expressed as: 
SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}, 
representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective 
from the information types resident on the SCADA system. The management at the power plant 
chooses to increase the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality from low to moderate reflecting 
a more realistic view of the potential impact on the information system should there be a security 
breach due to the unauthorized disclosure of system-level information or processing functions.</div><div id="chunk-6" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The 
final security category of the information system is expressed as: 
SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}. 5
