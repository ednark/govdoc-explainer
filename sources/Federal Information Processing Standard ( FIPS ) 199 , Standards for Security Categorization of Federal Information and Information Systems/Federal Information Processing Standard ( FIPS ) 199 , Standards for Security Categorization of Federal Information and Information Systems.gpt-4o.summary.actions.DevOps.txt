Certainly! Hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions a DevOps technician should focus on to ensure compliance with FIPS PUB 199 standards for a web application. Each item is geared towards designing and managing the infrastructure while prioritizing the three key security objectives: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Confidentiality
1. **Encryption in Transit:**
   - Ensure all data transmitted over the network is encrypted using TLS.

2. **Encryption at Rest:**
   - Use encryption mechanisms for storing sensitive data, such as database encryption.

3. **Access Controls:**
   - Implement strict access controls and role-based access to sensitive systems and data.

4. **Audit Logs:**
   - Enable logging for access and modification to sensitive data, and ensure logs are protected from unauthorized access.

### Integrity
1. **Hash and Validate Data:**
   - Use cryptographic hashing to validate data integrity and detect unauthorized changes.

2. **Version Control:**
   - Use a version control system for codebase to track and manage changes.

3. **Automated Testing:**
   - Implement automated tests to verify data integrity and application behavior after deployments.

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - Utilize configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef) to ensure infrastructure consistency.

### Availability
1. **Redundancy:**
   - Implement redundancy for critical components, such as servers and databases.

2. **Load Balancing:**
   - Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across servers and prevent overloading.

3. **Backup and Restore:**
   - Regularly perform backups and test data restoration procedures.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set up continuous monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to outages or performance issues.

### General Practices
1. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential security risks and mitigation strategies.

2. **Patch Management:**
   - Keep all software and dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.

3. **Compliance Audits:**
   - Perform periodic compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to required standards.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain detailed documentation of security measures, procedures, and incident response plans.

By focusing on these practical actions, a DevOps technician can help ensure the web application infrastructure complies with FIPS PUB 199 security categorization standards.
