Here is a minimal list of actions that a Drupal Developer must take to show compliance with the government standards, specifically focusing on information security:

1. **User Authentication**: Ensure that all users authenticate using secure, government-approved protocols (e.g., FIPS 140-2 compliant mechanisms).

2. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive information and functionalities based on user roles.

3. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit using strong encryption standards.

4. **Audit Logs**: Implement comprehensive logging to record all access and changes to sensitive data, including user activities and system events.

5. **Security Patches**: Regularly update Drupal core and all modules to ensure that the latest security patches are applied.

6. **Code Review**: Perform regular security code reviews to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in custom code and integrations.

7. **Session Management**: Implement secure session management practices to prevent session hijacking or unauthorized session access.

8. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

9. **Secure Configuration**: Ensure Drupal is configured securely according to best practices and government security guidelines.

10. **Backup and Recovery**: Implement a secure backup and recovery plan to protect against data loss.

These actions should help ensure compliance with the standards set forth in the provided Government Standards Document (12 FAM 500 â€“ INFORMATION SECURITY).
