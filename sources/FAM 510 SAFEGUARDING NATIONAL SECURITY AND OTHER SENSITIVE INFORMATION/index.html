Supervisors
(CT:DS-373;   01-25-2022)
(Uniform State, USAID, DFC, USTDA)
The responsibility for safeguarding classified information
rests with each supervisor to the same degree that the supervisor is charged
with functional responsibility for the organizational unit. While certain
employees may be assigned specific security responsibilities, such as Top
Secret control officer or unit security officer, it is nevertheless the basic
responsibility of supervisors to ensure that classified material entrusted to
their organizational unit is handled in accordance with the procedures required
by these regulations. Each supervisor should ensure that no single employee is
assigned an unreasonable amount of security responsibilities in addition to his
or her usual administrative or functional duties. 12 FAM 512.1-3
Employees
(CT:DS-373;   01-25-2022)
(Uniform State, USAID, DFC, USTDA)
Each employee having access to and/or possession of
classified material is responsible for maintaining the security of such
material. For the purposes of this policy, the term “employee”
includes anyone who is certified and/or authorized access to classified
information by virtue of a contract, consulting agreement, detail, grant,
appointment to an advisory panel, or otherwise.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Each employee must meet the
requirements of a “cleared U.S. citizen” (see
12 FAM 013
) for access to classified
information. 12 FAM 512.1-

Regional, Post, Bureau, or Unit Security
Officers
(CT:DS-415;   08-29-2023)
(Uniform State, USAID, DFC, USTDA)
Employees assigned as regional, post, bureau or unit
security officers have the supervisory and/or the oversight responsibility to
ensure that classified material entrusted to their organizational unit is
handled in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this volume. (See
12 FAM 423.
) 12 FAM 512.2
Evaluations, Surveys,
and Inspections
(CT:DS-373;   01-25-2022)
(Uniform State, USAID, DFC, USTDA)
The executive director of each bureau and each regional
security officer (RSO) must maintain the program designed to ensure compliance
with the provisions of these regulations. The executive director is
responsible for ensuring that the bureau has a designated security officer and
must work with that officer to ensure all employees are aware of the security
requirements. Within USAID, the Office of Security is responsible for
evaluating the effectiveness of the USAID Information Security Program and
ensuring that all regulatory requirements are met. 12 FAM 513
Insider Threat PROGRAM
12 FAM 513.1
Policy and Purpose
(CT:DS-373;   01-25-2022)
a. Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve
the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and
Safeguarding of Classified Information, dated October 7, 2011, requires all
U.S. Government executive branch departments and agencies to establish an
Insider Threat Program (ITP) for deterring, detecting, and mitigating insider
threats, including the safeguarding of classified information from
exploitation, compromise, or other unauthorized disclosure. b. An insider is defined by the National Insider Threat
Policy and Minimum Standards as, “[a]ny person with authorized access to
any United States Government resource to include personnel, facilities,
information, equipment, networks or systems.”  This includes employees,
defined as, “a person, other than the President and Vice President,
employed by, detailed or assigned to, a department or agency, including members
of the Armed Forces; an expert or consultant to a department or agency; an industrial
or commercial contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of a
department or agency, including all subcontractors; a personal services
contractor; or any other category of person who acts for or on behalf of a
department or agency as determined by the appropriate department or agency
head.”
c.  Insider threat is defined by the National Insider
Threat Policy and Minimum Standards as, “[t]he threat that an insider
will use her/his authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the
security of the United States.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> This threat can include damage through
espionage, terrorism, unauthorized disclosure of national security information,
or through the loss or degradation of departmental resources or
capabilities.”  As noted in the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2017, insider threat may also include a person who has, or once
had, authorized access and wittingly or unwittingly commits “a
destructive act, which may include physical harm to another in the
workplace.”  The ITP, therefore, focuses on the trusted insider who
misuses his or her access to do damage to the Department. d. The purpose of the ITP is to effectively and
efficiently:
(1)  Increase the awareness of current and former
employees to the vulnerabilities associated with the insider threat;
(2)  Deter employees from becoming insider threats;
(3)  Detect employees who pose an insider threat risk;
(4)  Provide enhanced protection of classified and
sensitive but unclassified information;
(5)  Identify the threat of or acts of workplace
violence and coordinate with the appropriate office to prevent or mitigate that
threat;
(6)  Identify employees on the critical path (“A
common set of factors and a similar pattern of individual and organizational
behavior,” Application of the Critical-Path Method, Shaw and Sellers
2015) and coordinate with the appropriate office to provide mitigation methods
to avoid incidents; and
(7)  Mitigate the risks to the Department’s
personnel, facilities, and information using training and administrative
measures; and by making referrals to the appropriate office. e. The ITP is based on the key pillars of:
(1)  Deterring harmful behavior;
(2)  Detecting anomalous activity or conduct;
(3)  Mitigating through data sources; and
(4)  Utilizing these data points for analytical and
response support. f.  To ensure ITP activities are conducted in
accordance with legal authorities
and to
ensure that any legal, privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties issues are
appropriately addressed, Department legal counsel and privacy and civil
liberties officials will be consulted regularly. The acquisition and use of
personal information to detect and prevent insider threats is authorized under
the E.O. 13587, the National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards, and
other national policies. Collected information is subject to oversight by
civil liberties and privacy authorities to ensure that personally identifiable
information is only gathered and used for legitimate and authorized purposes;
such information must be strictly controlled within the ITP and in accordance
with all record retention policies. 12 FAM 513.2
Applicability
(CT:DS-373;   01-25-2022)
The ITP authorities are applicable to all Department
personnel, to include employees, interns, contractors, and anyone under chief
of mission (COM) authority, as well as any individuals who access Department
facilities and/or information. The goal of the ITP is to manage the risk of
harm by an insider. 12 FAM 513.3
Authorities
(CT:DS-373;   01-25-2022)
