To show compliance with the government standards from the perspective of a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design, focusing on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI), consider the following minimal list of actions:

1. **Secure Login Design:**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication.
   - Ensure login screens support strong, complex passwords.

2. **Access Control Visibility:**
   - Make roles and permissions transparent to users where needed (e.g., admin panels).
   - Design for easy role-based access control (RBAC).

3. **User Activity Monitoring UI:**
   - Integrate unobtrusive activity logs and alerts for users, ensuring they are aware of monitoring.
   - Display banners informing users that their activities are being monitored.

4. **Clear Classification Markings:**
   - Use distinct visual styles (e.g., color codes, labels) for different information classification levels (e.g., restricted, sensitive).

5. **Error and Alert Warnings:**
   - Design alerts for unauthorized access attempts or sensitive activities.
   - Ensure error messages do not reveal sensitive information.

6. **Secure Information Presentation:**
   - Avoid displaying sensitive information unnecessarily.
   - Implement layered views for sensitive information, requiring additional verifications.

7. **Compliance Confirmation in UI:**
   - Include compliance confirmation prompts in workflows dealing with sensitive data.
   
8. **Privacy Notices and Consent:**
   - Display privacy and data usage notices, ensuring users consent to data collection and monitoring.
   - Design clear opt-in and acknowledgment steps for data policy agreements.

9. **Regular Security Training Prompts:**
   - Embed reminders or shortcuts to mandatory insider threat awareness training within the UI.

10. **User Feedback Mechanisms:**
    - Implement a secure channel within the application for users to report suspicious activities or security concerns.
