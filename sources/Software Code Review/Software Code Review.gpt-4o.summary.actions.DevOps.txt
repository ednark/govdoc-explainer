Certainly! Here is a minimal, actionable checklist of items a DevOps technician needs to address to ensure compliance with the FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements for a web application:

1. **Harden Scanners**:
    - Configure vulnerability scanners with hardened settings to resist unauthorized use or modification.

2. **Enable Authenticated Scanning**:
    - Ensure that scanners perform authenticated scans for Moderate and High systems wherever possible.

3. **Full Authorization Scanning**:
    - Configure scans to run with full system authorization to access all necessary registries and files.

4. **Machine-Readable Scan Outputs**:
    - Output scan results in a structured, machine-readable format (XML, CSV, or JSON) that includes authentication and authorization status.

5. **Use NVD-Referenced IDs**:
    - Include the NIST NVD CVE reference number in all machine-readable findings for each detected vulnerability.

6. **Apply CVSSv3 Scoring**:
    - Use the CVSSv3 base score from the NVD for vulnerabilities where available; otherwise, use CVSSv2 or native scanner scores.

7. **Signature Updates**:
    - Ensure the scanner's vulnerability definitions are updated at least monthly.

8. **Asset Identification**:
    - Maintain an automated inventory system to identify and catalog all assets monthly, including OS, web applications, and databases.

9. **Monthly Scans**:
    - Perform and document monthly scans on operating systems, web interfaces, and databases.

10. **Individual POA&M Entries**:
    - Track each unique vulnerability as an individual item in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M).

11. **Enable Non-Destructive Detections**:
    - Enable all non-destructive detections within the vulnerability scanner.

12. **Image Scanning**:
    - Regularly scan all virtual images used by federal government customers for vulnerabilities before deployment.

13. **Container Security (if applicable)**:
    - Use hardened container images.
    - Implement an automated container orchestration pipeline for build, test, and deployment.
    - Scan container images for vulnerabilities within 30 days prior to deployment.
    - Monitor the container registry to ensure compliance with the 30-day scanning window.
    - Assign unique asset identifiers to container images and maintain an automated inventory.
    - Encrypt all data in transit between containers.

14. **Report Scan Findings**:
    - Submit all monthly scan reports to the authorizing officials (AOs) or the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) as required.

15. **Notify and Approve Configuration Changes**:
    - Notify and obtain AO approval for any significant changes in scanner configurations beyond normal patches and updates.

By following these steps, a DevOps technician can ensure that their infrastructure design and management practices meet the compliance requirements set forth by FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements.
