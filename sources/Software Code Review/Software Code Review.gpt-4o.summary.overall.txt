### Summary of FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements (Version 2.0)

#### Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements:

1. **Document Purpose**:
   - Ensures continuous security monitoring for FedRAMP Authorized systems.

2. **Scanner Resiliency**:
   - Scanners must be resistant to unauthorized use or modification.

3. **Authenticated Scanning**:
   - Mandatory for Moderate and High systems, ensuring thorough scans.

4. **Scanning with Full Authorization**:
   - Scans must complete with full system authorization.

5. **Machine-Readable Findings**:
   - Scan results must be in structured formats like XML, CSV, or JSON.

6. **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**:
   - Include CVE reference numbers for vulnerabilities listed in NVD.

7. **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Risk Scoring**:
   - Use CVSSv3 base scores for rating vulnerabilities.

8. **Configuration Settings**:
   - Provide evidence that scanner settings match approved configurations.

9. **Configuration Changes**:
   - AO must approve any scanner configuration changes.

10. **Signature Updates**:
    - Update scanner's vulnerability database signatures monthly.

11. **Adequate Asset Identification**:
    - Scanner findings must map to a unique asset inventory.

12. **Types of Scans**:
    - Monthly scans for operating systems, web applications, and databases.

13. **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) Entries**:
    - Each unique vulnerability must be tracked individually.

14. **All Non-Destructive Detections**:
    - Enable all non-destructive detections in the scanner.

15. **Image Scanning**:
    - CSPs must scan all customer-leveraged virtual images.

#### Security Requirements for Systems Using Container Technology:

16. **Hardened Images**:
    - Only use "hardened" containers validated by a 3PAO.

17. **Container Build, Test, and Orchestration Pipeline**:
    - Use automated tools to build and test containers.

18. **Vulnerability Scanning for Container Images**:
    - Scan container images before deployment and ensure they are within a 30-day scanning window.

19. **Security Sensors**:
    - Use independent security sensors for ongoing container assessment.

20. **Registry Monitoring**:
    - Monitor registry to ensure only scanned images are deployed.

21. **Asset Management and Inventory Reporting for Deployed Containers**:
    - Track and report all deployed container instances and images.

22. **Encryption**:
    - Encrypt data in transit between containers and external sources.

#### Sections Highlighting Key Areas:
- **Security**:
  - Scanner Resiliency, Authenticated Scanning, Full Authorization, Encryption
- **Compliance**:
  - Machine-Readable Findings, NVD References, CVSS Risk Scoring, POA&M Entries, Configuration Settings, and Changes
- **User Experience**:
  - Types of Scans, Image Scanning to ensure up-to-date security.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Ensure regular updating and securing of container technology usage via hardened images and orchestrated pipelines.

This summary recaps the critical points without unnecessary detail, ensuring clarity and straightforward understanding.
