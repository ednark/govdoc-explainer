Sure, here are the actionable steps a Project Manager should take to ensure compliance with FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements specifically for a web application:

1. **Identify Assets**:
   - Catalog all servers, databases, and web applications within the system boundary.
   - Ensure each asset has a unique identifier.

2. **Select Vulnerability Scanners**:
   - Choose authorized and compliant scanning tools that meet FedRAMP requirements.

3. **Implement Authenticated Scanning**:
   - Ensure scanners are set up with administrative privileges to perform authenticated scans for Moderate and High-risk systems.

4. **Set Up Monthly Scanning**:
   - Schedule monthly scans for all operating systems, web applications, and databases.
   - Ensure reports are generated in machine-readable formats (XML, CSV, JSON).

5. **Update Scanner Configurations**:
   - Use 3PAO-validated configuration settings for scanners and verify that they remain unchanged.
   - Notify and get approval from the AO before making any changes to the scanner configurations.

6. **Vulnerability Sampling and Signature Updates**:
   - Ensure scanners are updated monthly with the latest vulnerability signatures.
   - Document and provide evidence of signature updates prior to scanning.

7. **Include CVE and CVSS Scores**:
   - Ensure scan findings include CVE references and CVSSv3 base scores.

8. **Maintain Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)**:
   - Track and document each unique vulnerability as its individual POA&M item.
   - Do not group multiple vulnerabilities under a single POA&M item.

9. **Report Compliance**:
   - Create monthly reports and submit them to the AO/JAB as part of continuous monitoring.
   - Reports should include unique asset identifiers and vulnerabilities.

10. **Monitor Configuration Changes**:
    - Validate that any changes to configuration settings are controlled and documented.

11. **Harden Containers** (if applicable):
    - Use hardened container images and validate configurations with 3PAO.

12. **Implement Security Sensors** (if applicable):
    - Deploy independent security sensors on production environments to continuously assess the security posture.

13. **Encrypt Data in Transit**:
    - Apply SC-8 controls (encryption) to all data in transit between containers, services, or other systems.

By systematically tracking and ensuring the completion of these steps, a Project Manager can effectively guide their team to maintain FedRAMP compliance for a web application project.
