Certainly! Here's a minimal list of actions a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design, responsible for UX and UI, must take to show compliance with the FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements for a web application:

1. **Collaborate on Authentication**:
    - Ensure designs support secure authentication processes, enabling authenticated scans.

2. **Implement Secure Configurations**:
    - Design UI to facilitate configuration management, blocking unauthorized changes and minimizing unnecessary features and services.

3. **User Roles and Permissions**:
    - Design interfaces to clearly manage user roles and permissions for full authorization of scans.

4. **Data Visibility**:
    - Ensure scan status and vulnerability findings are displayed in a structured, machine-readable format within the UI (consider using formats like XML, CSV, JSON).

5. **Clear Error Messaging**:
    - Standardize vulnerability and error messages to include references like CVEs and risk scores.

6. **Secure Data Handling**:
    - Design interfaces that ensure data in transit between containers, or off-premise, is always encrypted (meeting SC-8 controls).

7. **System Alerts**:
    - Make space within the UI for alerts related to registry monitoring and unauthorized deployments.

8. **UI for Reports**:
    - Design and include interface elements that allow for monthly vulnerability reporting to AO/JAB.

9. **Plan of Action Interface**:
    - Create UI components to log and track individual vulnerabilities as POA&M items.

10. **Automated Evidence Sharing**:
    - Enable features that allow uploading and automated sharing of machine-readable evidence of scanner settings and recent updates.

11. **Scanning and Inventory Management**:
    - Implement dashboard views for displaying asset scanning status and inventory details.

12. **User Education**:
    - Incorporate clear guidance and educational tooltips on secure practices and required scanner configurations.

By focusing on these actions, a designer can ensure the user interface and user experience of the web application are compliant with the necessary FedRAMP standards while maintaining security and usability.
