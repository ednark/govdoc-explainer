For a Drupal developer implementing backend business logic to show compliance with the FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements, here is a minimal list of actions:

1. **Use Hardened Images**: 
   - Utilize only hardened containers/images that adhere to NIST standards or 3PAO-validated benchmarks.
   - Ensure all images are free from known vulnerabilities listed in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalog.

2. **Authenticated Scanning**: 
   - Implement authentication mechanisms in the backend that allow scanning tools to perform authenticated scans.

3. **Logging Configuration**: 
   - Ensure Drupal logs configurations and access controls are auditable and align with security guidelines that support full authorization scans.

4. **Encryption Implementation**:
   - Encrypt data in transit as per SC-8 controls, ensuring secure communication between containers and the backend.

5. **Configuration Management**:
   - Maintain configuration settings according to 3PAO-validated settings and ensure any changes are approved by the AO.

6. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Integrate automated vulnerability scanning into the deployment pipeline to scan container images and Drupal updates before they go into production.
   - Schedule regular scans and include necessary metadata inline with requirements.

7. **Asset Identification**:
   - Implement mechanisms for unique asset identification and logging of all backend components within the Drupal platform.

8. **POA&M Entries**:
   - Track and log each vulnerability detected in Drupal as individual POA&M items, ensuring they are properly documented and managed.

9. **Reporting Vulnerabilities in Machine-Readable Formats**:
   - Ensure that the output of vulnerability scans is stored in structured, machine-readable formats like XML, CSV, or JSON.

10. **Monitor Container Registry**:
    - Keep track of container activity to prevent unscanned or outdated containers from being deployed in a production environment.

By following these actions, a developer specializing in Drupal can help ensure compliance with FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements from a backend business logic implementation perspective.
