Certainly! For a DevOps technician, here is a concise list of actions to ensure compliance with the government standards related to DNSSEC:

1. **Enumerate Domains:**
   - List all second-level .gov domains managed by the agency.

2. **Identify DNS Services:**
   - Determine and document if DNS services are in-house, outsourced, or provided by another agency.

3. **DNS Server Infrastructure:**
   - Inventory current DNS server implementations (e.g., BIND, NSD, Microsoft Advanced Directory).
   - Document the number of servers per provider.

4. **Deploy DNSSEC:**
   - Ensure DNSSEC is enabled on all DNS servers.
   - Generate DNSSEC key pairs and sign the DNS zones.

5. **Configure DNSSEC:**
   - Update DNS server configurations to support DNSSEC.
   - Publish DNSSEC keys in the DNS.

6. **Implement Monitoring:**
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for DNSSEC validation failures and key expiration.

7. **Address Barriers:**
   - Identify and document any technical or operational barriers to DNSSEC deployment.
   - Develop and execute a plan to overcome these barriers.

8. **Train Staff:**
   - Attend DNSSEC training workshops and pilot programs (such as the USG Secure Naming Infrastructure Pilot).

9. **Test and Validate:**
   - Conduct regular testing of DNSSEC configurations.
   - Validate signed zones and ensure proper resolution.

10. **Document Compliance:**
    - Maintain documentation for all DNSSEC activities and configurations.
    - Report compliance status to appropriate stakeholders and authorities.

By following these actions, a DevOps technician can ensure that an applicationâ€™s infrastructure complies with the relevant government DNSSEC standards.
