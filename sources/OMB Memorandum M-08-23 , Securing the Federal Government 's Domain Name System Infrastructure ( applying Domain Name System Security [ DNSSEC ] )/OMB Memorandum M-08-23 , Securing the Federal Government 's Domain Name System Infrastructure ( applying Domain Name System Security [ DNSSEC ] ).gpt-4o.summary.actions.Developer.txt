To ensure compliance with the provided Government Standards Document from a Drupal developer's perspective, especially in regards to implementing backend business logic, consider the following minimal list of actions:

1. **Identify Relevant Domains**:
   * Enumerate the .gov sub-domains that your Drupal application operates on or interacts with.

2. **Secure DNS Information**:
   * Ensure that DNS settings for your domains meet DNSSEC requirements, referenced in NIST Special Publication 800-81.

3. **Configure DNSSEC**:
   * Work with your DNS provider or IT team to verify and configure DNSSEC for your domains. 
   * Implement necessary DNSSEC records (e.g., DS, RRSIG) in your domain name settings.

4. **Implement Secure URL Handling**:
   * Enforce HTTPS for all .gov domains to ensure secure communication between users and your application.

5. **Monitor for Compliance**:
   * Use available tools to regularly test and ensure DNSSEC compliance on your domains (check tools from NIST or DNSSEC Deployment Initiative).
   
6. **Log and Audit Logs**:
   * Implement logging for all DNS-related activities to ensure any issues can be traced and resolved quickly.

7. **Stay Informed on Policies**:
   * Keep up-to-date on changes to DNSSEC policies and guidelines, participating in relevant training and workshops as necessary (e.g., those by the Secure Naming Infrastructure Pilot).

By following these steps, you can help ensure that the Drupal-based web application complies with the specified government DNSSEC requirements.
