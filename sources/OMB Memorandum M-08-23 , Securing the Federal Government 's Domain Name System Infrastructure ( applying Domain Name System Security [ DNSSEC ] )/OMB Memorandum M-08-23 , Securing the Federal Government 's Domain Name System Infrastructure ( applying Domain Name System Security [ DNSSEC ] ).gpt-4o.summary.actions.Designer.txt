For a web application, the following are the minimal list of actions from the perspective of a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design, focusing on compliance with the government standards related to DNSSEC:

1. **Understand DNSSEC Requirements:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the basics of DNSSEC to understand its importance and how it affects the user experience.

2. **User Communication:**
   - Design clear messages and notifications for users that explain the security measures taken, emphasizing DNSSECâ€™s role in protecting their data.
   - Ensure that error messages related to DNS issues are user-friendly and informative.

3. **Accessibility Compliance:**
   - Ensure that all DNSSEC-related information and notifications are accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

4. **Security Indicators:**
   - Integrate visual indicators or icons that inform users of the secure status of the connection, leveraging common security symbols (such as padlocks for secure connections).

5. **User Education:**
   - Develop Help and Support content that educates users about DNSSEC and its benefits in enhancing the security of their interactions with the application.

6. **User Testing:**
   - Conduct usability testing to ensure that DNSSEC notifications and security indicators are understood by non-technical users.
   - Gather feedback to improve the user experience in relation to security measures.

7. **UI Consistency:**
   - Ensure that all DNSSEC-related components maintain consistency with the overall design and branding of the application.

By focusing on these actions, the Designer can contribute to the application's compliance with DNSSEC standards while ensuring a smooth and secure experience for the end users.
