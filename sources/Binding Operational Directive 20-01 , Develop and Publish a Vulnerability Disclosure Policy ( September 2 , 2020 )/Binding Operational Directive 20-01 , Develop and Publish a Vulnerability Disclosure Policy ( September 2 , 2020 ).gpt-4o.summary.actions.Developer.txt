### Minimal List of Actions for Compliance with Government Standards from a Developer's Perspective

1. **Security Contact Configuration**:
   - Update the .gov registrar with a monitored security contact email for the domain.
   - Ensure the Organization field identifies the responsible agency component.

2. **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) Page**:
   - Publish the VDP as a public webpage at `/vulnerability-disclosure-policy` on the agencyâ€™s primary .gov website.
   - Confirm URL accessibility and correct rendering in HTML/plain text.

3. **VDP Content Requirements**:
   - Define scope with at least one internet-accessible system or service.
   - List permitted and prohibited testing activities.
   - Provide report submission details (e.g., email address or web form).
   - Include a statement allowing anonymous reports and commit non-pursuance of legal action for good faith reports.
   - Set expectation for report acknowledgments and remediation steps.
   - Include an issuance date.

4. **Scope Inclusion**:
   - Ensure all newly launched internet-accessible systems or services are included under the VDP.

5. **Handling Procedures Implementation**:
   - Establish a tracking system for vulnerability reports.
   - Set up internal communication protocols for report handling and remediation.
   - Develop a prioritization method for fixing reported vulnerabilities.
   - Define timelines for report acknowledgment, assessment, and resolution.

6. **Security Mechanisms**:
   - Ensure HTTPS is enforced across all web services.
   - Implement secure token mechanisms for communication interfaces.

7. **Regular Updates**:
   - Add at least one internet-accessible system or service to the VDP scope every 90 days until all are included.
   - Update the VDP with new system inclusions.

8. **CISA Reporting**:
   - Report valid newly discovered vulnerabilities to CISA immediately.
   - Report metrics on disclosure reports and resolution progress as required.

By following these steps, the developer ensures compliance with the key minimal actionable items required by the Government Standards Document for web applications, specifically when specializing in Drupal.
