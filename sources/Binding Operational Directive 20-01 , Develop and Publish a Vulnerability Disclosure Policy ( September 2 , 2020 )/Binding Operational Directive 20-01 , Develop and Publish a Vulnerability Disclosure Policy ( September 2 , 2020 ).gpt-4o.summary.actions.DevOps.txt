To ensure compliance with the standards from the perspective of a DevOps technician managing infrastructure for a web application, here is a minimal list of actions:

1. **Set Up a Security Contact Email:**
   - Register a team email address (e.g., security@youragency.gov) and ensure it is regularly monitored.

2. **Configure the .gov Registrar:**
   - Add the security contact email and update the "Organization" field for each .gov domain.

3. **Establish Vulnerability Reporting Procedures:**
   - Enable the receipt of vulnerability reports via the security contact email or a dedicated web form.

4. **Implement an HTTPS-Only Policy:**
   - Ensure all web applications and their vulnerability reporting forms use HTTPS for secure communication.

5. **Publish a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP):**
   - Host a VDP at the “/vulnerability-disclosure-policy” path on the primary .gov website, detailing in-scope systems and authorized testing methods.

6. **Monitor and Triaging System:**
   - Have personnel regularly check and triage vulnerability reports received through the security contact.

7. **Expand Scope of VDP:**
   - Gradually add more internet-accessible systems to the VDP every 90 days until all are covered.

8. **Develop Handling Procedures:**
   - Document procedures for tracking, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities. Include timelines for responses and prioritization rules.

9. **Coordinate Communication:**
   - Establish a communication plan with reporters to acknowledge receipt of reports and provide progress updates.

10. **Report Metrics to CISA:**
    - Collect and report metrics such as the number of vulnerability reports, valid vulnerabilities, resolution times, etc., to CISA quarterly.

11. **Audit and Update Systems:**
    - Regularly audit the systems included in the VDP and ensure any new internet-accessible services are added to the policy immediately.

12. **Ensure Legal Compliance:**
    - Ensure the VDP clearly states that no legal action will be taken against security researchers who follow the policy in good faith.

These actions cover the critical aspects of infrastructure support related to vulnerability management and help align with the required government standards.
