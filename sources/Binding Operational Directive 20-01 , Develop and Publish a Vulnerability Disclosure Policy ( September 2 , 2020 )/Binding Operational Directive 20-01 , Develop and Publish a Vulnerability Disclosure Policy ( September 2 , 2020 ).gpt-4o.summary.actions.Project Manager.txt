Certainly! Here's a minimal list of actions a Project Manager should ensure to show compliance with the standards for a web application project:

1. **Publish VDP**: 
   - Ensure a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) is published at the “/vulnerability-disclosure-policy” path of the primary .gov website.

2. **Encode Contact Information**:
   - Update the .gov registrar with a monitored security contact email (e.g., security@agency.gov).
   - Update the Organization field on the .gov registrar with the relevant agency component.

3. **Enable Receiving Reports**:
   - Set up an email or web form to receive vulnerability reports. Ensure this is regularly monitored.

4. **Define Scope and Testing Guidelines**:
   - Clearly state which systems/services are in scope for vulnerability testing.
   - Specify allowed and prohibited types of testing.

5. **Legal Commitment**:
   - Include a statement in the VDP not to pursue legal action for good faith security research.

6. **Communication Protocols**:
   - Define how and when reporters will receive acknowledgment and updates on their reports.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Create a document change history in the VDP and ensure ongoing updates are version-controlled.

8. **Track and Report Metrics**:
   - Track and regularly report vulnerability metrics through CyberScope as required.

9. **Implement Handling Procedures**:
   - Develop and follow procedures for tracking, assessing, and fixing reported vulnerabilities.

10. **Include All Internet-Accessible Systems**:
   - Continuously increase the scope of the VDP to ultimately include all internet-accessible systems/services.

By ensuring these actions, the Project Manager can guide the team and client towards demonstrating compliance with the given government standards.
