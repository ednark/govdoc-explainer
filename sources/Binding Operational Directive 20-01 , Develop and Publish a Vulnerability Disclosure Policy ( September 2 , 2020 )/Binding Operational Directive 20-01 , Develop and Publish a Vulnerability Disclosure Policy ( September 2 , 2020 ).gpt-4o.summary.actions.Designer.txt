Certainly! Here’s a minimal list of action items for a Designer who specializes in Human Centered Design (HCD) to ensure compliance with the relevant government standards for a web application:

1. **User-Friendly Security Contact Accessibility:**
   - **Design a prominent link** on the homepage or in the footer pointing to the Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) at “/vulnerability-disclosure-policy”.
   - **Create a clear and accessible web form** for reporting vulnerabilities, ensuring it is easy to find via the main navigation or support sections.

2. **Plain Language Use:**
   - **Ensure all security-related content** and instructions are written in plain language, avoiding legalese or technical jargon, so it’s easily understandable by the general public.

3. **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) Design:**
   - **Design the VDP page** to include key elements: systems in scope, types of testing allowed, submission guidelines, anonymity options, and legal disclaimers.
   - **Incorporate a user-friendly FAQ section** that addresses common queries about vulnerability reporting.

4. **Accessible Reporting Mechanism:**
   - **Ensure the reporting form is accessible** (e.g., WCAG compliance), allowing users with disabilities to report vulnerabilities without barriers.

5. **Consistent User Experience:**
   - **Maintain consistent design and branding** throughout the VDP and all security-related pages to build trust and familiarity.
   - **Use standard icons and visuals** to denote security-related sections (e.g., shield icon for security contact).

6. **Transparent Communication:**
   - **Design email templates** for automated acknowledgment messages and follow-up communication with vulnerability reporters.
   - **Include a progress tracker or status updates section** in the user dashboard for those who report vulnerabilities, showing where their report stands in the resolution process.

7. **Privacy Considerations:**
   - **Design disclosure forms** to avoid collecting unnecessary personally identifiable information (PII), only asking for voluntary contact details if needed.

8. **Acknowledgment Section for Contributors:**
   - **Design a public acknowledgment page** for those who report vulnerabilities (with their consent), recognizing their contribution to security.

By focusing on these specific areas, a designer specializing in HCD can help ensure that the web application not only complies with government standards but also offers a user-friendly and supportive experience for users contributing to its security.
