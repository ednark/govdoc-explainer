Certainly! For a Designer focused on Human Centered Design with responsibilities towards User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI), here’s a focused list to ensure compliance with the Government Standards for data retention:

1. **Clarify Terms:**
   - Integrate definitions for "data" and "record" into design documentation.

2. **Metadata Inclusion:**
   - Ensure UI captures and displays metadata fields like origin, contact info, data creation details, archiving date, purpose, and retention schedule.
  
3. **PII and PHI Identification:**
   - Design features that clearly label or tag Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI).

4. **Privacy Impact Notice:**
   - Incorporate Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) results into the UI, ensuring it's visible when required.
  
5. **User Permissions and Restrictions:**
   - Develop UI components for easily managing who can access or restrict archives and data records.

6. **Archival Location Info:**
   - Display information about where data and records are archived within the application.

7. **Automated Archiving Notices:**
   - Design alerts or notifications for users when data is automatically archived.

8. **Data Sharing Permissions:**
   - Create intuitive settings or controls for users to manage data sharing preferences.

By adhering to these actions, a Designer can contribute significantly to the project’s compliance with data retention standards while enhancing user experience.
