   - Reinstate OpenNet access only upon course completion and compliance verification.

3. **Counterintelligence and Insider Threat Training (EX250/EX251):**
   - Verify that all team members undertake the required annual counterintelligence and insider threat training.
   - Maintain a log of training completion for internal monitoring purposes.

4. **Classified Information Handling Training (PK400):**
