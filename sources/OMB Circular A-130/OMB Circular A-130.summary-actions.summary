To ensure compliance with government standards for managing a web application project, especially with respect to handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and ensuring proper information security, you would generally need to follow these minimal actions:

1. **Conduct a Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the types of data handled by the application, particularly PII, and assess potential risks related to privacy and security. 

2. **Categorize Information:** Determine the sensitivity of the information processed by the application and categorize it accordingly (e.g., PII should be treated as sensitive), guiding how this information must be handled and protected.

3. **Develop a Privacy Policy:** Create and maintain a publicly accessible privacy policy that complies with legal requirements and explains how PII is collected, used, stored, and shared. Review and update this policy regularly or as needed based on changes in the application or relevant regulations.

4. **Implement Privacy Controls:** Apply administrative, technical, and physical controls to manage access to PII and protect it from unauthorized access and breaches. This includes encryption of data in transit and at rest, secure access methodologies, and regular auditing of access logs.

5. **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Integrate security and privacy considerations throughout the development lifecycle of the applicationâ€”from planning to deployment and maintenance. Include security and privacy by design principles.

6. **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA):** Conduct evaluations of how PII is handled to ensure the application does not negatively impact the privacy of individuals and complies with the applicable laws and regulations.

7. **Training and Awareness:** Provide regular training for all developers and personnel involved in managing the web application on current security practices and compliance requirements. This includes updates on handling PII and responding to privacy breaches.

8. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain a plan for responding to data breaches or security incidents, including the immediate actions to take, notification procedures, and mitigation strategies.

9. **Vendor Management:** Ensure that third-party services and vendors comply with relevant security and privacy standards. Include necessary clauses in contracts where third-party vendors are involved in processing or storing PIP.

10. **Continuous Monitoring and Compliance:** Regularly review and update security measures and compliance procedures. Use continuous monitoring tools to keep track of compliance with privacy standards and spot potential security vulnerabilities.

11. **Documentation and Audit Trails:** Keep detailed records of data handling and protection measures, including changes to the system and access details, to provide audit trails for compliance verification.

12. **Legal Compliance:** Stay updated with relevant laws and regulations that affect your web application. Ensure all compliance requirements are met and documented appropriately.

By ensuring these actions are adequately addressed, your project should demonstrate compliance with government standards relating to the management and protection of information within web applications.
