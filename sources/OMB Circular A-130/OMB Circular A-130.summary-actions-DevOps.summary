For a DevOps technician tasked with designing and managing infrastructure for a web application project, ensuring compliance with government standards primarily outlined in Circular A-130 and its appendices involves focusing on several crucial actions:

1. **Security Categorization**: Classify the application and its data based on their impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using FIPS Publication 199 criteria.

2. **System Security Plan**: Develop and maintain a detailed system security plan documenting the security requirements and security controls implemented to meet those requirements.

3. **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access the application and its data, using multi-factor authentication and the principle of least privilege.

4. **Encrypt Data**: Ensure data is encrypted in transit and at rest using FIPS-validated cryptographic modules, considering the impact level of the application and its data.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish a continuous monitoring strategy to detect, report, and respond to threats in real time, ensuring the ongoing effectiveness of the security controls.

6. **Incident Response**: Develop and maintain a robust incident response policy and procedure to effectively handle security breaches and minimize impact.

7. **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)**: Conduct and document a PIA to evaluate privacy risks associated with the application, particularly where personal identifiable information (PII) is involved.

8. **Privacy Controls Integration**: Integrate privacy controls into the system development life cycle to protect users' PII from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and disposal.

9. **Risk Management**: Execute a comprehensive risk management strategy, continually assessing and responding to security and privacy risks throughout the applicationâ€™s life cycle.

10. **Contractor Control**: Ensure all contracts and agreements with third parties include terms that mandate compliance with federal security and privacy requirements.

11. **Compliance Documentation**: Regularly update all compliance documentation to reflect any changes or updates in the application infrastructure, ensuring accurate and current compliance records.

12. **Training and Awareness**: Conduct regular security and privacy training for all personnel involved in managing and operating the application to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in maintaining security and compliance.

Each of these actions is mandatory in demonstrating compliance with government standards, especially when working under government contracts for public-facing web applications. These steps ensure both data integrity and security while aligning with federal requirements specified in Circular A-130 and its appendices.
