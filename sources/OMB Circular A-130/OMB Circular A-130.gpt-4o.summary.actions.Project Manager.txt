To ensure compliance with the Government Standards Document from a project manager's perspective, here are the minimal actions to be taken for a web application project:

1. **Identify and Implement Security Controls:**
   - Conduct a risk assessment.
   - Select and implement baseline security controls (NIST SP 800-53).

2. **Categorize Information Systems:**
   - Determine the impact level (FIPS Pub 199).
   - Document the information system categorization.

3. **Develop and Maintain Documentations:**
   - Develop a System Security Plan (SSP).
   - Create and maintain a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).
   - Maintain a privacy plan detailing relevant controls.

4. **Ensure Privacy Protection:**
   - Limit PII creation, collection, storage, and processing to what is necessary.
   - Regularly review and update PII inventory.
   - Verify compliance with the Privacy Act and other legal requirements.

5. **Deploy Multifactor Authentication:**
   - Implement multifactor authentication for users.
   - Secure sensitive information with encryption.

6. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Develop a continuous monitoring strategy (NIST SP 800-137).
   - Implement a continuous monitoring program.
   - Monitor and assess controls periodically.

7. **Incident Response Plan:**
   - Establish an incident response policy and procedure.
   - Periodically test and review the incident response plan.

8. **Employee and Contractor Training:**
   - Implement mandatory security and privacy training programs.
   - Ensure role-based training for personnel with significant security roles.

9. **Ensure Contract Compliance:**
   - Include privacy and security requirements in vendor/supplier contracts.
   - Verify contractors meet these compliance obligations.

10. **Obtain Authorization to Operate:**
    - Compile an authorization package and review it.
    - Gain approval from the project's authorizing official.

11. **Document and Manage Configuration Changes:**
    - Establish a process for managing system changes.
    - Conduct impact analyses for changes related to security and privacy.

12. **Report Compliance Metrics:**
    - Regularly submit performance metrics and FISMA reports as required. 

Tracking and organizing these key actions ensure project alignment with the standards and helps effectively manage the compliance requirements.
