To ensure compliance with standards from a Human Centered Design perspective, a Designer specialized in User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) should perform the following minimal list of actions:

1. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure the web application meets Section 508 standards for accessibility.

2. **Privacy Notices:**
   - Include clear and accessible privacy policies on all user-facing pages.

3. **Data Collection Transparency:**
   - Inform users about what personal data is being collected and the purpose of collection.
   - Obtain user consent through clear and intuitive mechanisms (e.g., checkboxes, pop-up dialogues).

4. **User Data Rights:**
   - Design interfaces allowing users to access and amend their personal information.
   - Include functionalities to opt-out or delete their data.

5. **Security Notices:**
   - Display security information and best practices to users (e.g., password strength indicators, session timeouts).

6. **User Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Implement easy-to-find features for users to provide feedback or raise privacy concerns.

7. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Design interfaces for MFA to enhance user security.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - Create clear error messages explaining why data collection or submission failed, including privacy or security issues.

9. **Data Encryption Notices:**
   - Notify users when sensitive data is being encrypted (e.g., secure checkout)

10. **Mobile Device Compatibility:**
    - Ensure privacy and security settings are consistent across all devices, including mobile platforms.

11. **User Training Prompts:**
    - Incorporate onboarding tutorials or prompts to educate users on security and privacy best practices.

12. **Incident Reporting:**
    - Design user interfaces to simplify reporting of security incidents or data breaches.

13. **Regular Updates:**
    - Include UI designs that can easily accommodate updates for compliance (e.g., alerts for policy changes).

By focusing on these actionable items, a Designer can ensure that the user experience aligns with government standards for privacy, security, and accessibility, while also meeting user needs and enhancing overall trust in the application.
