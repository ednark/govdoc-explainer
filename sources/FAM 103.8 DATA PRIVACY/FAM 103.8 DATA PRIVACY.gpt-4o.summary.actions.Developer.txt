To ensure compliance with the government standards related to data privacy for a Drupal developer working on backend business logic, the minimal list of actions to be taken on a project includes:

1. **Form Approval & Privacy Act Statement**:
   - Integrate only OMB-approved forms for PII intake.
   - Display the Privacy Act Statement and control number on appropriate forms.

   - Follow the department’s data preparation and storage policies for handling PII.

4. **Data Usage Compliance**:
   - Ensure PII is utilized strictly according to the department’s data use policy.
