Certainly! Here's a minimal list of actions that a DevOps technician should take to ensure compliance with relevant government standards for the web application project:

1. **Approval for PII Forms**:
   - Ensure all PII intake forms are OMB approved and display the Privacy Act Statement and a control number.

2. **Data Identification and Tagging**:
   - Identify and tag all instances of PII in datasets as per the Department's policy on Data Preparation and Storage.

3. **Controlled PII Sharing**:
   - Implement measures ensuring PII is shared on a “need to know” basis and create redacted versions of classified data if necessary.

4. **Access Control**:
   - Enforce strict access controls for PII in line with the Department’s policy on Data Access.

5. **Risk Mitigation in Data Aggregation**:
   - Follow the Department’s guidance on risk mitigation when aggregating data.

6. **Data Protection Measures**:
   - Secure data in compliance with the Department’s Data Privacy policy, 5 FAM 460.

7. **Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)**:
   - Work with the Privacy Office in A Bureau to obtain a PIA for systems/projects collecting, maintaining, or disseminating PII about the public.

By taking these steps, your DevOps infrastructure will align with the mandatory guidelines set forth in the government standards document.
