Certainly! Here's a concise list of actions for a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design to ensure the web application complies with the government data privacy standards:

1. **Forms Design**: Ensure all forms collecting PII include the approved Privacy Act Statement and control number.
  
2. **Data Identification**: Design interfaces to easily tag and identify instances of PII within the datasets.

3. **Access Control**: Design access controls to ensure data access is limited to a "need to know" basis.

4. **User Permissions**: Make sure the UI supports features that manage user permissions according to data use policies.

5. **Data Sharing UI**: Provide UI elements to facilitate sharing redacted versions of data when necessary.

6. **Risk Mitigation**: Design features that help users follow risk mitigation guidelines when aggregating data.

7. **Privacy Office Coordination**: Include interfaces for gathering and processing information required to coordinate with the Privacy Office for obtaining a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).

8. **Compliance Information Display**: Ensure that any relevant compliance and data protection information is clearly displayed to users where necessary. 

By ensuring these components are included and properly embedded into the User Experience and User Interface, the designer will help the web application adhere to the government standards for data privacy.
