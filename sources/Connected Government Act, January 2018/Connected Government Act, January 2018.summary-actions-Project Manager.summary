To ensure compliance with the standards outlined in the Connected Government Act and related guidelines, as a project manager overseeing the development of a federal agency's public-facing web application, you should implement the following actions:

1. **Confirm Mobile-Friendliness**:
   - Ensure that the web application is designed to be navigable, viewable, and accessible on various mobile devices including smartphones and tablets. Use responsive web design or adaptive design strategies to achieve this.

2. **Perform Usability Testing**:
   - Conduct usability tests to validate the mobile-friendly design. Include testing on real mobile devices to better understand the user interactions and ensure compatibility across different screen sizes and operating systems.

3. **Incorporate Accessibility Features**:
   - Implement features that adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) ensuring the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

4. **Consult Analytics for Mobile Optimization**:
   - Use analytics to understand mobile user behavior and adapt the design and functionality to improve the user experience based on real data.

5. **Optimize Performance and Loading Times**:
   - Focus on optimizing the application’s performance especially for mobile devices. This includes minimizing load times and ensuring smooth performance on constrained networks.

6. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement robust security protocols to protect user data and ensure the application’s compliance with federal security standards.

7. **Engage with Stakeholders Regularly**:
   - Keep regular communications with all stakeholders including clients, design teams, and development teams to ensure everyone is aligned with the compliance requirements.

8. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation of all steps taken to comply with mobile-friendly and accessibility standards. Report these compliances as required by the Connected Government Act.

9. **Review and Update Compliance**:
   - Regularly review the application against the latest federal guidelines and standards to ensure ongoing compliance. Update the application as necessary to meet evolving standards and technologies.

Each of these actions must be meticulously planned, executed, and documented to ensure that your project not only complies with the federal standards but also serves its intended audience effectively.
