Certainly! Here is a minimal list of actions a Drupal developer must take to ensure compliance with the government standards:

1. **Ensure Mobile-Friendliness**
   - Implement responsive web design using flexible grids, images, and CSS media queries.
   - Test across a range of devices and viewports using Chrome Developer Tools or similar.

2. **Follow Accessibility Standards**
   - Ensure compatibility with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
   - Use Drupalâ€™s built-in accessibility features and modules.

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Implement caching (e.g., Drupal cache, Varnish) and use content delivery networks (CDNs).
   - Optimize CSS, JavaScript, and images for faster load times.

4. **Conduct Usability Testing**
   - Perform usability testing to ensure ease of navigation and interaction on mobile devices.
   - Use Drupal's Responsive Preview functionality for initial testing.

5. **Secure the Application**
   - Follow security best practices, including regular updates to Drupal core and modules.
   - Implement secure data handling and user authentication practices.

6. **Use Structured Content**
   - Leverage structured content and APIs to make the content platform-agnostic.
   - Use content types and fields wisely to ensure consistency.

7. **Enable Analytics**
   - Integrate with the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) for tracking and analysis.
   - Ensure analytics are set up to capture mobile visitor data effectively.

By following these steps, a Drupal developer can substantially align the project with the required government standards.
