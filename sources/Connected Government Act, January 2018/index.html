Connected Government Act
Connected Government Act
As of July of 2018, all new and redesigned agency websites are required to be mobile-friendly. The
Connected Government Act
(H.R.2331) was signed into law on January 10, 2018, and requires new and redesigned federal agency public websites to be mobile-friendly. The
General Services Administration
(GSA) and
Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) submitted a report to Congress in 2019 that describes how agencies can implement the law and assess their compliance. Law
H.R.2331

What Is Mobile-Friendly? Mobile-friendly means a digital product can be navigated, viewed and accessed on a smartphone, tablet computer, or similar mobile device. Is Your Site Mobile-Friendly? Many of us get toward the end of mobile site development and really do not know if what we created is “mobile-friendly.” We think we have followed all of the mobile best practices and performed usability testing. However, do we have something concrete to quantitatively certify that we are mobile-friendly? https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/23/is-your-site-mobile-friendly/

Is Crowdsourcing the Future of Mobile Design and Development? This is the first government smartwatch app development we’ve talked about on DigitalGov and an example of a great mobile moment use case. Not only is the smart app interesting (see the UI images!) but also how NASA is approaching its development is worth examining. While agencies are crowdsourcing via native apps and crowdsourcing their actual mobile development, none have publicly crowdsourced just the app design. https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/13/trends-on-tuesday-is-crowdsourcing-the-future-of-mobile-design-and-development-2/
Agency Examples and Recommendations

Open and Structured Content Models Workshop Recap
The Open and Structured Content Models Working Group, an interagency working group, has been exploring the approach for government and they have created two open and structured content models—one for articles and one for events. They hosted a workshop so agencies could hear from a few organizations who are already putting these ideas into practice. Attendees discussed how to build the case for the content model approach, how the models work in practice and how to implement the existing models.</div><div id="chunk-6" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/10/27/open-and-structured-content-models-workshop-recap/
Mobile Content: Less is More
How big is your smartphone? Way smaller than a desktop monitor. The user will have a radically different experience on a desktop, and they are usually expecting a different experience. https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/08/31/mobile-content-less-is-more/
How to Make a Mobile Paper Prototype
Well before we get into the design and coding phases, we can show customers a mockup of an idea of what our product might look like. It’s called a prototype (or a wireframe)—it’s a model of a design that’s still in development. It doesn’t need to be fancy, or even made on a computer. But it can make the difference between a product that looks good and one that people will actually use. https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/22/how-to-make-a-mobile-paper-prototype/
Design Sketching: The Easiest Prototype Method Ever
Smart designers create a “low-fidelity” prototype of your product—a rough approximation of what it’s going to look like so people can actually interact with it. https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/08/08/design-sketching-the-easiest-prototype-method-ever/
