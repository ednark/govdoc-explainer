<ul>
<li><strong>Is Your Site Mobile-Friendly?</strong> <br />Many of us get toward the end of mobile site development and really do not know if what we created is “mobile-friendly.” We think we have followed all of the mobile best practices and performed usability testing. However, do we have something concrete to quantitatively certify that we are mobile-friendly? <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/23/is-your-site-mobile-friendly/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/23/is-your-site-mobile-friendly/</a></li>

<li><strong>Mobile First Webinar Recap</strong> <br />A “mobile first” approach is where new websites and applications are designed for mobile devices first, instead of designed for the traditional desktop. Representatives from government and the private sector spoke about what it means to be “mobile first.” <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2012/08/03/mobile-first-webinar-recap/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2012/08/03/mobile-first-webinar-recap/</a></li>
<li><strong>How Contact Centers are Adapting to the Mobile User</strong> <br />According to this study by Compare Business Products, one of the most important impacts for contact centers is that smartphone users can now connect with contact centers via voice calls, SMS messages, Internet pages, social media video chat and native apps. <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/04/22/trends-on-tuesday-how-contact-centers-are-adapting-to-the-mobile-user/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/04/22/trends-on-tuesday-how-contact-centers-are-adapting-to-the-mobile-user/</a></li>
<li><strong>Structured Content and the Power of Syndication</strong> <br />Structured content and APIs form the core of any open content platform, whether it be syndication or other types of data sharing. <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/11/09/the-content-corner-structured-content-and-the-power-of-syndication/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/11/09/the-content-corner-structured-content-and-the-power-of-syndication/</a></li>
<li><strong>Is Crowdsourcing the Future of Mobile Design and Development?</strong> <br />This is the first government smartwatch app development we’ve talked about on DigitalGov and an example of a great mobile moment use case. Not only is the smart app interesting (see the UI images!) but also how NASA is approaching its development is worth examining. While agencies are crowdsourcing via native apps and crowdsourcing their actual mobile development, none have publicly crowdsourced just the app design. <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/13/trends-on-tuesday-is-crowdsourcing-the-future-of-mobile-design-and-development-2/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/13/trends-on-tuesday-is-crowdsourcing-the-future-of-mobile-design-and-development-2/</a></li>

<li><strong>How to Make a Mobile Paper Prototype</strong> <br />Well before we get into the design and coding phases, we can show customers a mockup of an idea of what our product might look like. It’s called a prototype (or a wireframe)—it’s a model of a design that’s still in development. It doesn’t need to be fancy, or even made on a computer. But it can make the difference between a product that looks good and one that people will actually use. <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/22/how-to-make-a-mobile-paper-prototype/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/22/how-to-make-a-mobile-paper-prototype/</a></li>

<h3 id="native-apps-or-progressive-web-apps">Native Apps or Progressive Web Apps</h3>
<p>Should you focus your efforts on either of these two options?</p>
<h4 id="native-apps">Native Apps</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planning with a Purpose: 3 Reasons Why Agencies Created Native Apps</strong> <br />Agencies who have created native apps outlined three areas they considered in the mobile development process: strategy, business requirements and measuring value. <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/07/01/planning-with-a-purpose-3-reasons-why-agencies-created-native-apps/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/07/01/planning-with-a-purpose-3-reasons-why-agencies-created-native-apps/</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="progressive-web-apps">Progressive Web Apps</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progressive Web Applications, Part 1: the New Pack Mule of the Internet</strong> <br />Progressive Web Apps have been able to take the best of native and web applications and combine them into a hybrid application that is fast (with or without a fast network connection), can work across devices, and does not need to be distributed through a store as it is as linkable and shareable as a web page. <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/09/20/progressive-web-applications-part-1-the-new-pack-mule-of-the-internet/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/09/20/progressive-web-applications-part-1-the-new-pack-mule-of-the-internet/</a></li>
<li><strong>Progressive Web Applications, Part 2: Pros, Cons, and Looking Ahead</strong> <br />Along with the advantages, PWAs bring challenges, and these may be deal breakers for some. <br /><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/10/13/progressive-web-applications-part-2-pros-cons-and-looking-ahead/">https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/10/13/progressive-web-applications-part-2-pros-cons-and-looking-ahead/</a></li>
