3. **Accessibility Compliance**: Adhere to Section 508 standards to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities. This includes ensuring text alternatives for non-text content, making all functionality available from a keyboard, and more.

4. **Conduct Usability Testing**: Regularly test the application with real users to gather feedback and make iterative improvements. Focus on mobile usability given the mobile-first mandate.

5. **Optimize Performance**: Enhance the applicationâ€™s loading times and performance on mobile devices. Utilize tools and techniques for optimizing images, leveraging browser caching, and minifying CSS and JavaScript.
