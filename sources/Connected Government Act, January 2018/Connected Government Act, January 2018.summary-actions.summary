To ensure compliance with the standards set forth by the Connected Government Act and other relevant resources from your document, focus on the following key actions for your web application project:

1. **Ensure Mobile Friendliness:**
   - Design and develop the web application to be navigable, viewable, and accessible on mobile devices including smartphones and tablets. Use responsive design techniques or adaptive design strategies.

2. **Conduct Usability Testing:**
   - Regularly test the user interface and experience with actual mobile devices across various screen sizes and operating systems. Include testing for ease of use, accessibility, and user interaction.

3. **Optimize Performance:**
   - Work on making the application efficient on mobile devices. Focus on optimizing page load speeds, responsive images, and server-side enhancements to reduce latency.

4. **Ensure Accessibility:**
   - Comply with accessibility guidelines such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to make sure the app is usable for people with disabilities. Regular audits and adjustments should be scheduled.

5. **Follow Security Best Practices:**
   - Implement robust security measures to protect user data and ensure privacy. This includes secure coding practices, regular security testing, and updates following best industry practices.

6. **Adhere to Legal and Privacy Requirements:**
   - Incorporate necessary privacy policies and ensure that the application complies with data protection regulations relevant to government web applications, including handling personally identifiable information (PII) securely.

7. **Perform Compatibility Testing:**
   - Ensure that the application displays and functions correctly across multiple types of devices and browsers. Consider using tools for cross-browser and cross-device testing.

8. **Engage in Continuous Improvement:**
   - Use analytics to monitor user interaction and feedback to continuously improve the user experience. Pay attention to user behavior and preferences to inform future updates.

9. **Document Compliance Efforts:**
   - Keep detailed records of all processes and procedures in place to meet government standards, including design decisions, testing results, and compliance checklists.

By following these steps, your web application project will align with the government's standards for mobile-friendly, accessible, and secure public web applications.
