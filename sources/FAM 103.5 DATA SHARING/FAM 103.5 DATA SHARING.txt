Data sharing
(CT:DATA-3;   05-18-2023)
When practicing
Data Sharing
within their
organizational unit, Data Stewards should:
(1)  Only share datasets from authoritative data
sources, where they exist.
(2)  Notify known users of significant changes to data.
(3)  Ensure data sets, or a specific portion of it, are
shared using standardized Data Sharing Agreements (DSAs) and follow enterprise
DSA documentation principles, if applicable.
(4)  Ensure DSAs incorporate language on the sharing
party’s right to audit data use to ensure data is used as intended.
(5)  Share SBU data within the Department only on a “need
to know” basis.
(6)  If possible and only as appropriate, create a redacted
version that removes classified data so that it can be shared broadly.
