Certainly! Here’s a minimal list of actions a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design (HCD) for a web application should take to show compliance with the given government standards for data sharing:

1. **Identify Authoritative Data Sources:**
   - Ensure that datasets used in the application come from trusted, official data sources only.

2. **User Notifications:**
   - Implement a user notification system to inform known users of any significant data changes.

3. **Standardized DSAs:**
   - Integrate features that facilitate adherence to Data Sharing Agreements (DSAs) in line with enterprise documentation principles.

4. **Audit Language in DSAs:**
   - Design interfaces that support features for parties to audit data usage, ensuring the data is used as intended.

5. **Need-to-Know Basis:**
   - Restrict views and access to Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) data based on a "need to know" basis, aligning with user roles and permissions.

6. **Redacted Data Availability:**
   - If applicable, design mechanisms to provide redacted, non-classified datasets that can be shared more broadly while protecting sensitive information.

By incorporating these actions into the design and user experience of the web application, the Designer ensures compliance with the specified government standards for data sharing.
