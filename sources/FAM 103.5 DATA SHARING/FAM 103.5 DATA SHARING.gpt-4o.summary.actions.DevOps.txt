To ensure compliance with the 20 FAM 103.5 Data Sharing standards from a DevOps perspective, the following minimal list of actions should be taken:

1. **Use Authoritative Data Sources:**
   - Configure data integrations to pull from officially sanctioned databases.

2. **Change Notifications:**
   - Implement automated notifications for users when datasets change significantly.

3. **Standardized DSAs:**
   - Implement and enforce Data Sharing Agreements (DSAs) protocols for all data exchanges.

4. **Audit Capabilities:**
   - Incorporate logging and tracking mechanisms to enable auditing of data usage.

5. **Need-to-Know Access Controls:**
   - Implement granular access control lists (ACLs) to ensure SBU data is accessible only to authorized personnel.

6. **Redacted Data Sets:**
   - If applicable, create and manage redacted data sets for broader sharing by masking or removing classified information.

By addressing these specific actions, the DevOps technician can help ensure that the infrastructure supports compliance with the government's data sharing standards.
