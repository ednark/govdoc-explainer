Certainly! Hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions that a DevOps technician should take to ensure compliance with the relevant portions of the government standards outlined:

1. **Assess Training Needs**: Identify if the team's contractors require any proprietary system training that is necessary for job execution.

2. **Coordinate Training**: Work with the contracting officer representative or training officer to get approval for any necessary training for contractors.

3. **Track Training**: Keep a record of all training approvals and completions for contractors to ensure compliance with the policy.

4. **Submit Tuition Waivers**: If applicable, submit requests for tuition waivers to the FSI Director when training on proprietary systems is needed and in the best interest of the Department.

5. **Monitor Availability**: Ensure that requested training for contractors is available on a space-available basis, as per policy.

6. **Implement Infrastructure Readiness**: Ensure that the necessary infrastructure and environments are set up to support any special requirements resulting from the training.

These brief actions help ensure the appropriate steps are taken to align with the relevant policy on training contractors per the Government Standards Document.
