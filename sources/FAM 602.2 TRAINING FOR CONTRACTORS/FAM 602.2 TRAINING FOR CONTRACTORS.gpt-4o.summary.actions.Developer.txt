Certainly! From the perspective of a developer specializing in implementing Drupal, here is a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with the given government standards:

1. **Training Request Approval:**
   - Coordinate with the contracting officer representative or training officer to get any required training approved for working on the project.

2. **Identify Training Needs:**
   - Assess and specify any proprietary systems or specific tools you need training on to meet contract job requirements.

3. **Space-Available Basis Training:**
   - Confirm that there is space available for the required training sessions at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI).

4. **Verify Training Costs:**
   - Ensure if tuition applies to the necessary training. If so, ascertain the approval for a tuition waiver from the FSI Director if it's in the department's best interest.

5. **Document Training:**
   - Keep records of all training approvals and completed training sessions to demonstrate compliance.

This list should help maintain the necessary compliance related to training requirements as outlined by the government standards for developers in a web application project.
