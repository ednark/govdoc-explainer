To ensure compliance with the FedRAMP Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) standards, a project manager should focus on the following key actions:

1. **Identify Privacy Officer (POC):**
   - Assign a Privacy Officer who will act as the Point of Contact.

2. **Understand Applicable Laws and Regulations:**
   - Review relevant laws and regulations as outlined on www.fedramp.gov.

   - Establish if the application will collect, store, or process Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

4. **PII Mapping:**
   - Create documentation mapping PII to specific application components.

5. **Prospective PII Use:**
   - Clarify the sources and purpose of any PII being collected or processed. 

6. **Access and Sharing:**
   - Define who will have access to PII, including third-party organizations and internal personnel, and document the criteria and procedures for access.

7. **Safeguards and Liabilities:**
   - Implement and document controls to prevent misuse of PII, and assign responsibility for PII protection.

8. **Contracts and Agreements:**
   - Ensure contracts with customers outline PII ownership, privacy responsibilities, notification requirements, and liability terms.

9. **Accuracy and Redress:**
   - Establish processes for verifying and maintaining the accuracy of PII and for allowing individuals to correct or amend their information.

10. **Retention and Disposal:**
    - Define retention periods for PII and procedures for secure disposal after the retention period.

11. **Monitor and Track Access:**
    - Set up mechanisms to monitor and track access to PII.
