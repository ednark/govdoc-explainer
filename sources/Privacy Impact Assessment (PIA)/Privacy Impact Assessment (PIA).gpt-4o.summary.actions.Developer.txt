To show compliance with FedRAMP standards from the perspective of a Drupal developer working on backend business logic, the minimal list of actions is as follows:

1. **Identify PII**:
   - Determine what types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will be collected, stored, or processed by the application.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel can access PII.
   - Ensure access to PII requires approval from a manager.

3. **PII Data Mapping**:
   - Map all data fields that will store PII and ensure they are properly marked and protected.

4. **Encryption**:
   - Implement encryption for PII both at rest and in transit.
   
5. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the minimum necessary PII required for the application's functionality.
   
6. **Audit Logs**:
   - Enable logging to track access and modifications to PII data.

7. **Privacy Safeguards**:
   - Implement measures to prevent the unauthorized browsing or misuse of PII by users with access.

8. **Contracts and Agreements**:
   - Ensure that all code libraries and third-party services are compliant with FedRAMP standards.

9. **Data Accuracy and Retention**:
   - Build mechanisms for data validation to ensure the accuracy of PII.
   - Implement data retention policies and ensure proper disposal of PII after the retention period.

10. **Transparency**:
    - Make sure the application's privacy policy is accessible and the use of PII is transparent to users.

11. **Training**:
    - As part of the development cycle, ensure that any team member with access to PII receives proper privacy and security training.

By addressing these areas, a developer can contribute effectively to ensuring FedRAMP compliance for a Drupal-based web application.
