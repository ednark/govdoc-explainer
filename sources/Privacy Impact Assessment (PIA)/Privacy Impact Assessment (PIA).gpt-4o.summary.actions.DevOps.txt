From the perspective of a DevOps technician, here are the minimal actions needed to ensure compliance with the government standards, specifically focusing on privacy and Personally Identifiable Information (PII):

1. **Identify PII Collection Points:**
   - Map out all application components and identify where PII is collected, stored, and processed.

2. **Implement Access Controls:**
   - Set up role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel have access to PII.
   - Ensure that access to PII requires managerial approval.

3. **Data Encryption:**
   - Encrypt PII both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols.

4. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Enable logging and monitoring to track access to PII.
   - Implement tools to alert when unauthorized access to PII occurs.

5. **Regular Security Training:**
   - Ensure annual security and privacy training for all staff who have access to PII.

6. **Data Retention and Disposal:**
   - Define and implement data retention policies in accordance with federal guidelines.
   - Establish secure procedures for data disposal (e.g., shredding, degaussing).

7. **Incident Response Plan:**
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan that includes actions to take if PII is compromised.

8. **Document Compliance:**
   - Maintain documentation showing that these controls and processes are in place and reviewed regularly.

9. **Post Privacy Policy:**
   - Ensure the privacy policy is publicly viewable and kept up to date.

10. **Contractual Agreements:**
    - Verify that vendor and contractor agreements include privacy and data protection clauses as per NIST SP 800-144.

By focusing on these actions, a DevOps technician can demonstrate compliance with the standards for managing infrastructure in support of the application while ensuring PII is protected.
