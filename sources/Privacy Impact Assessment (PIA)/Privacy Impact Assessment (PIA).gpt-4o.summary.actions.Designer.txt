Certainly! Here are the minimal actions a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design should take to ensure compliance with the FedRAMP Privacy Impact Assessment standards:

1. **Identify and Label PII:**
   - Clearly identify and label all UI elements that will collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

2. **Consent Mechanisms:**
   - Ensure there are mechanisms (e.g., checkboxes, consent forms) for users to provide explicit consent before collecting any PII.

3. **Privacy Notice:**
   - Include a clear and concise privacy notice linked prominently on all pages where PII is collected, explaining why the information is collected and how it will be used.

4. **Access Controls:**
   - Implement UI elements that allow users to control their privacy settings, including the ability to view, modify, and delete their PII.

5. **Transparency:**
   - Design the interface to inform users what PII is being collected, who will have access to it, and for what purposes.

6. **Data Minimization:**
   - Ensure the UI only requests the minimum amount of PII necessary for the function it supports.

7. **Security Indications:**
   - Use visual indicators to show that data transmission is secure, such as an SSL certificate indicator in the form of a lock icon.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - Provide clear error messages when PII input does not meet specified criteria to ensure accurate data collection.

9. **User Access Requests:**
   - Include interfaces for users to submit requests to view, correct, or delete their PII.

10. **Retention Information:**
    - Clearly display information about PII retention policies and how long the data will be stored.

Each action ensures that the user's privacy is respected and that the application complies with FedRAMP PIA requirements.
