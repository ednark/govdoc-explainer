### Summary of Government Standards for DevOps Implementations

#### 1. Mandatory Use of .gov or .mil Domains
- **Security and Compliance:** All official agency communications, information, and services must exclusively use .gov or .mil domains, unless specific third-party domains are necessary (e.g., social media, code collaboration platforms).

#### 2. Free Domain Registration
- **User Experience and Compliance:** As of April 2021, .gov domains are available free of charge for eligible registrants, including agencies. This aims to encourage utilization and streamline the management of these domains.

#### 3. Domain Registration and Renewal Procedures
- **Security, Accessibility, and Compliance:** Agencies must obtain approval from their Chief Information Officer or head of the agency for domain registrations or renewals. Details such as the intended use, primary users, rationale behind the domain choice, and alignment with OMB policies must be provided.
- **Security Review:** OMB will review domain requests to ensure compliance, prevent conflicts, and reduce public confusion over government services.

#### 4. Oversight and Reporting Requirements
- **Security and Compliance:** Continuous reporting and review of non-.gov domain utilization are required under the Memorandum M-22-09, aiming for adherence to Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles. OMB holds the authority to review usage and may mandate cessation or change of domain usage to ensure compliance.

#### 5. Policy Rescissions and Updates
- **Compliance:** This document supersedes and replaces several prior memoranda and sections relevant to federal digital services and public websites, ensuring that current guidelines reflect up-to-date policies.

### Condensed Summary
- **.gov/.mil Domains:** Mandatory for all official uses to ensure security and compliance; free registration to promote uniformity and ease of management.
- **Domain Management:** Registering or renewing a domain requires approval and must detail usage plans, targeting both security and clarity for users.
- **Oversight and Compliance:** Strict ongoing monitoring of domain use, with OMB overseeing adherence to security and policy frameworks, promoting transparency and minimizing public confusion regarding official communications.
- **Updated Directives:** Current guidelines replace earlier versions, consolidating requirements and reflecting modern digital governance standards.
