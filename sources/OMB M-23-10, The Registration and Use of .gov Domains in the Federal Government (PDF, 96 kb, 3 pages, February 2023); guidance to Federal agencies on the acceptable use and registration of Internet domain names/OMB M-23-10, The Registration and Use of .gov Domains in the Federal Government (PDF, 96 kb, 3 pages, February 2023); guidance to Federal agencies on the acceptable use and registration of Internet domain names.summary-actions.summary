Certainly! Here’s a summarized list of actions to ensure compliance with the government standards outlined in the memorandum, particularly for projects involving web applications:

1. **Use of .gov or .mil Domains**: Ensure that the web application uses a .gov or .mil domain for hosting all official communications, information publications, and service deliveries as mandated for credibility and security.

2. **Register/Renew Domains Appropriately**: Follow the correct process and meet specific requirements for registering or renewing .gov domains as described on the .gov Registry's website. The approval must be from the agency’s Chief Information Officer or the head of the agency, along with a sufficient description of the domain's intended use.

3. **Review Domain Compliance**: Within 180 days from the issuance of the standards document, review all previously registered domains to verify compliance with the required domain naming conventions and other domain-specific requirements outlined by the .gov Registry.

4. **Manage Third-Party Services**: For services that need to operate on non-government domains (like social media or code repositories), document their usage and ensure they are essential for interacting effectively with the public. Regularly report these usages as per OMB requirements.

5. **Ensure Domain Needs Reflection**: Carefully consider the potential public impact and government interaction when selecting a domain name, avoiding overused or confusing names that could lead to misalignment with the domain’s intended purpose.

6. **Domain Conflict Handling**: Be responsive to any OMB queries about domain name conflicts or issues with name requests and be prepared to alter or transfer domain ownership if OMB deems it necessary to resolve conflicts or reduce. confusion.

7. **Stay Updated with Policies**: Stay informed about and comply with any new updates or changes to the regulations governing the use of government domains from OMB and other relevant authorities.

By following these steps, a project involving web applications can demonstrate compliance with the government's standards for domain registration and usage.
