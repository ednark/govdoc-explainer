Here's a concise list of actions you, as the Project Manager, need to undertake to ensure compliance with government standards regarding the use of .gov domains:

1. **Domain Registration**: Register all necessary .gov domains needed for the project through the official .gov Registry website (https://get.gov).

2. **CIO Approval**: Ensure that domain name requests have approval from the agency's Chief Information Officer or the agency head, including a detailed rationale for the domain's intended use.

3. **Review Domain Compliance**: Within 180 days from the date of registration, review existing domains to ensure they meet the specific requirements for naming conventions and usage as stated on the .gov Registry's website.

4. **Official Communications**: Use .gov or .mil domains for all official communications, ensuring all agency outreach, information, services, and digital products operate under these domains unless specific exceptions are warranted (like third-party services).

5. **Report and Monitor Non-.gov Domain Usage**: Continuously track and report any utilization of non-.gov domains for transparency and review by OMB, adhering to the directives provided in previous memorandums like M-22-09.

6. **OMB Interaction and Compliance**: Prepare to respond to OMB inquiries regarding domain use and participate in the resolution of any domain-name conflicts or non-compliance issues as directed by OMB.

7. **Stewardship of Domains**: Act as a steward of .gov and .mil domains by managing them effectivelyâ€”ensure they are actively used, clearly communicate information, and embody trustworthy public service.

These steps will help in managing your project in alignment with the latest government requirements outlined in the OMB memorandum regarding the registration and use of .gov domains.
