1. **Use .gov or .mil Domains**: Ensure all official communications, information dissemination, and service delivery through the web application are hosted under .gov or .mil domains as per government mandate to reassure users of the authenticity and security of the site.

2. **Domain Registration Compliance**: Follow strict compliance with the .gov domain registration process which includes approval from either the agency’s Chief Information Officer or head of the agency. Ensure the domain name is relevant, clear, and as per the guidelines specified on the .gov Registry's site.

3. **Review and Report Non-.gov Domain Usage**: If there are any operational needs to use non-.gov domains (e.g., third-party services like social media or source code repositories), these should be reported and justified to OMB as per the directives. Make sure to regularly report and review the usage of such domains.

4. **Ensure Domain Name Clarity and Relevance**: Each domain name should directly relate to the agency’s mission and the specific service or information it intends to provide. Avoid using overly complex or ambiguous names to prevent confusion and maintain public trust.

5. **Domain Conflict Management**: Actively participate in the resolution of domain name conflicts and adhere to OMB’s guidelines to either change or relinquish domain names if directed, to avoid public confusion or duplication of similar domains.

6. **Update and Retire Domains Appropriately**: Regularly assess the utility and relevance of registered domains. Register new domains as needed, reuse existing ones effectively, or retire those that are no longer in use, aligning with current operational requirements and ensuring efficient communication.

Implementing these steps should ensure that your web application complies with the standards set forth in the government memorandum concerning the use of .gov domains while maintaining high standards of public trust and data security.
