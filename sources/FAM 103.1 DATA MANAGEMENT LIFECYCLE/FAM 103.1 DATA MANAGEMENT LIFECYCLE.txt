Data management
lifecycle Overview
(CT:DATA-4;   06-12-2023)
a. The enterprise data management lifecycle has five
phases: Data Onboarding, Data Preparation and Storage, Data Use, Data Sharing,
and Data Retention (see Figure 2). There are also four policy areas that
cross-cut the data management lifecycle and require their own expertise. These
are Data Privacy, Data Security, Data Stewardship, and Data Access.
b. The Department is currently developing enhanced data
security guidance in line with Executive Order 14208: Improving the
Nation’s Cybersecurity, OMB M-22-09 on the Federal Zero Trust
Architecture, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Zero
Trust Maturity Model.
