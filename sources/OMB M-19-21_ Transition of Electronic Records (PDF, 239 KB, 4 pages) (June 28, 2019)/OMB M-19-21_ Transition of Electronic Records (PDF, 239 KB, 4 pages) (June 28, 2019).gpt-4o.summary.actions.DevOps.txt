For a DevOps technician managing a web application infrastructure to comply with the provided government standards, here’s a minimal list of actionable steps:

1. **Migrate Data Storage**:
   - Ensure all records (permanent and temporary) are stored in electronic formats.
   
2. **Metadata Management**:
   - Implement metadata standards for all stored electronic records to ensure appropriate labeling and indexing.

3. **Infrastructure Automation**:
   - Automate record creation and management processes to minimize manual intervention and ensure compliance.
   
4. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Ensure storage and backup solutions comply with security and federal records management laws and policies, including encryption standards.

5. **Cloud Readiness**:
   - Use government-approved cloud services or commercial storage facilities that meet NARA records storage requirements for temporary and permanent records.

6. **Retention Policies**:
   - Implement and manage record retention policies to ensure timely archiving and deletion in line with NARA schedules.

7. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Establish robust disaster recovery plans to ensure electronic record preservation and recovery.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Set up continuous monitoring and logging mechanisms for recordkeeping activities for audit and compliance verification.

9. **Digitization Process**:
   - Develop processes for digitizing any analog records that must be transitioned to electronic formats.

10. **Interagency Transfers**:
    - Plan for the secure and compliant transfer of electronic records to NARA or other designated storage as required by regulations.

These actions will help ensure that your web application’s infrastructure is designed to support fully electronic recordkeeping in compliance with the government’s standards.
