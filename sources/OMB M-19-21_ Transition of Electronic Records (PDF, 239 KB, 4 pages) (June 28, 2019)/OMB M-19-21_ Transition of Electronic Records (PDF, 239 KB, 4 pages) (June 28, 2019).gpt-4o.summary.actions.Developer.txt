From the perspective of a Drupal developer implementing backend business logic for a web application, the minimal list of actions to show compliance with the given government standards would be:

1. **Electronic Record Management:**
   - Ensure all backend business logic creates, retains, and manages records in electronic formats with appropriate metadata.

2. **Email Records:**
   - Implement mechanisms to manage all email records electronically, complying with the standard practices set since 2016.

3. **Metadata Compliance:**
   - Integrate metadata management to support the transfer of records to NARA with appropriate metadata.

4. **Temporary Record Storage:**
   - Ensure logic supports the eventual transfer and storage of temporary records in commercial storage facilities when necessary.

5. **Record Scheduling:**
   - Implement mechanisms to handle the disposition schedules for records, ensuring compliance with NARA-approved schedules.

6. **Digital Workflows:**
   - Update business logic to support transitioning to electronic workflows, ensuring existing practices are adjusted as needed.

7. **Data Transfer Systems:**
   - Create features to facilitate the transfer of records to Federal Records Centers or commercial storage facilities.

8. **Digitization Support:**
   - Ensure backend logic supports digitizing analog records and handles their conversion and management as electronic records.

By focusing on these actions, the Drupal developer can contribute significantly to ensuring the project's compliance with the specified government standards.
