To ensure compliance with government standards as a DevOps technician when designing and managing infrastructure for a web application, you should focus on the following key actions:

1. **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDF):**
   Incorporate secure software development practices as outlined in SP 800-218, ensuring all phases of development from planning to deployment are secure. This includes code review, automation of security testing, and integrating security at every step.

2. **Apply Access Control Measures:**
   Implement robust access control measures in line with SP 800-162 (ABAC), ensuring that only authorized individuals can access certain data and system functionality. Employ least privilege principles.

3. **Patch Management:**
   Establish a consistent patch management strategy based on SP 800-40 Rev. 4 to regularly update software and infrastructure components, safeguarding them from known vulnerabilities.

4. **Secure Configuration Management (SCM):**
   Follow guidance from SP 800-128 to properly configure operating systems, applications, and network devices securely, mitigating unnecessary risks.

5. **Incident Response Preparedness:**
   Prepare for potential cybersecurity incidents by adopting practices from SP 800-61 Rev. 2, which includes developing an incident response plan that addresses identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

6. **Data Protection and Privacy:**
   Secure personally identifiable information (PII) complying with SP 800-122, ensuring that data storage, processing, and transmission are secured to protect user privacy.

7. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   Implement systems and processes for the continuous monitoring of security controls as recommended in SP 800-137, ensuring ongoing awareness of any anomalies or security events that could impact the infrastructure.

8. **Vulnerabilities and Threat Management:**
   Use vulnerability assessment tools and techniques from SP 800-115 to identify, evaluate, and mitigate vulnerabilities. Include regular scans and threat modeling for proactive management.

9. **Cloud Security (if using cloud services):**
   If leveraging cloud technologies, ensure compliance with SP 800-144 for secure and private cloud deployments. This involves deploying security configurations, managing cloud-based data, and ensuring service level agreements.

10. **Use of Cryptographic Processes:**
    Follow SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 for managing cryptographic key generation, distribution, usage, and destruction. Employ encryption to protect data integrity and confidentiality during transmission and storage.

Following these steps will help ensure that the infrastructure supporting your web applications not only complies with the necessary government standards but is also robust against various security threats.
