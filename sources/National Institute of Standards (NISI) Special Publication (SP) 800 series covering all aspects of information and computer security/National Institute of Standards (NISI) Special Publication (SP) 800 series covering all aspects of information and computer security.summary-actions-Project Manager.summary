To ensure compliance with the relevant NIST standards for a web application project, as a project manager, you would need to organize and guide your team to perform the following key actions:

1. **Identify Relevant Standards**:
   - Review NIST SP 800 and FIPS series documents to identify standards specific to computer/information security that are applicable to the web applicationâ€™s nature and data sensitivity.

2. **Implement Security Controls**:
   - Implement security controls as outlined in NIST SP 800-53, adjusting for your organization's specific needs. Include controls for access, audit, encryption, and incident response.

3. **System Security Plan**:
   - Develop and maintain a System Security Plan as recommended in SP 800-18, documenting all security measures for the system including purpose, descriptions, environment, and the security controls in place.

4. **Risk Assessment and Management**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment following guidance from SP 800-30 to identify, assess, and plan risk mitigation strategies. Continuously manage risks throughout the project lifecycle.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Implement an Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) strategy as per SP 800-137 to keep track of security controls' effectiveness and make adjustments based on any changes in the threat landscape.

6. **Incident Response Plan**:
   - Establish an incident response plan guided by SP 800-61, detailing procedures for managing security breaches, including detection, response, recovery, and post-event analysis.

7. **Patch and Vulnerability Management**:
   - Develop procedures for regular updates and patch management of the software and infrastructure to protect against vulnerabilities, as per best practices in SP 800-40.

8. **Privacy Controls**:
   - Implement privacy controls specific to the protection of personally identifiable information (PII), in line with SP 800-122 and relevant privacy laws to ensure protection and confidentiality of user data.

9. **Secure Development Practices**:
   - Follow secure software development practices as outlined in SP 800-64, ensuring security is integrated in all phases of software development from design to deployment.

10. **Training and Awareness**:
    - Conduct regular training sessions and create awareness programs for your team about their roles and responsibilities in maintaining cybersecurity, based on guidelines from SP 800-50.

11. **Compliance Documentation**:
    - Keep detailed records of all compliance efforts, audit results, and corrective measures taken. This documentation will be vital for both internal audits and compliance verification during external reviews.

12. **Peer Reviews and Updates**:
    - Regularly consult and update your practices based on new releases, public drafts, and final publications from NIST, adapting to new security challenges and technologies.

Organizing and directing your team to carry out these actions systematically will help ensure that your web application remains compliant with NIST standards, thus enhancing its security posture against potential cybersecurity threats.
