To ensure compliance with NIST standards when developing and hosting a web application, the following actions should be taken:

1. **Implement Access Control Mechanisms**: Adhere to SP 800 series guidelines to ensure that users are properly authenticated and authorized to access system resources. Employ methods such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

2. **Data Encryption**: Protect data at rest and in transit by implementing cryptographic methods from the SP 800 series and FIPS standards. Ensure that encryption algorithms and protocols meet or exceed federal requirements for data security.

3. **Continuous Vulnerability Management**: Regularly scan the application and its host environment to identify vulnerabilities. Follow guidelines from SP 800 series on implementing a secure patch management process to address identified security issues promptly.

4. **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDF)**: Follow best practices outlined in SP 800-218 for integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle. This includes threat modeling, secure coding, and security testing.

5. **Auditing and Monitoring**: Implement regular system auditing and monitoring according to NIST guidelines (e.g., SP 800-53A) to detect, log, and analyze security events. Establish procedures for responding to security incidents as outlined in SP 800-61.

6. **Risk Assessment and Management**: Follow guidelines in SP 800-30 for conducting risk assessments and managing risks. Include considerations for cybersecurity and privacy risks in all phases of application design and deployment.

7. **Data Protection and Privacy**: Adhere to NIST guidelines for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data (e.g., SP 800-122 and SP 800-144). Implement proper data sanitization and disposal methods as per SP 800-88.

8. **Regular Compliance Checks and Assessments**: Conduct regular assessments to ensure compliance with relevant SP 800 series controls, FIPS standards, and any applicable federal regulations. Adjust policies and procedures as required to maintain or improve compliance posture.

By executing these steps, you demonstrate active adherence to NIST standards and federal regulations, thereby enhancing the security and integrity of your web application while also fulfilling compliance requirements.
