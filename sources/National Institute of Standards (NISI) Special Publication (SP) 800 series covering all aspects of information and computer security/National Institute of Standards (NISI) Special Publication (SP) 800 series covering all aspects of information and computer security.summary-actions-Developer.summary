For a developer implementing Drupal for a government-contracted web application, compliance with NIST standards is essential. Here is a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with relevant cybersecurity and privacy standards, particularly focusing on the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800 series which provides guidance on computer/information security:

1. **Implement Access Control Measures**: Follow NIST SP 800 guidelines for robust access control. Incorporate measures that enforce user authentication, authorization, and secure session management. Ensure the Drupal deployment adheres to the least privilege principle and role-based access controls.

2. **Secure Data Encryption**: Utilize encryption methods for data at rest and in transit as outlined in NIST SP 800-52, 800-57, and 800-175 series. This involves encrypting database connections, stored data, and ensuring the secure configuration of SSL/TLS for web traffic.

3. **Apply Secure Development Practices**: Integrate security into the software development lifecycle as described in NIST SP 800-64 and 800-180. This includes input validation to protect against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and implementing security headers and other HTTP security configurations.

4. **Conduct Regular Vulnerability Assessments**: Regularly test and audit the Drupal environment and codebase against vulnerabilities, as recommended in NIST SP 800-115. Employ automated tools and manual testing techniques to identify and remediate security weaknesses.

5. **Adopt Patch Management**: Follow guidance from NIST SP 800-40 regarding patch management. Regularly update Drupal core and any third-party modules to their latest secure versions to protect against known vulnerabilities.

6. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure comprehensive logging of user activities, system events, and security incidents as recommended by NIST SP 800-92. Enable and configure Drupalâ€™s logging and monitoring capabilities to support incident detection and response efforts in compliance with NIST SP 800-61.

7. **Secure Configuration**: Adhere to NIST SP 800-123 for general server security and employ guides specific to web services like NIST SP 800-44 for securing public web servers. Configure Drupal settings and server configurations to enhance security, minimizing exposure to threats.

8. **Back Up and Recovery**: Establish robust data backup and disaster recovery processes as recommended in NIST SP 800-34. Ensure that backups are performed regularly and that recovery procedures are well-tested to ensure continuity in case of a cybersecurity incident.

9. **Privacy Protections**: Adhere to guidelines in NIST SP 800-122 for protecting personally identifiable information (PII). This includes data minimization practices, secure data handling procedures, and transparency in data usage within the Drupal application.

10. **Risk Management**: Follow the Risk Management Framework outlined in NIST SP 800-37 and 800-39 to evaluate and address risks associated with your web application. This should include continuous risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and the integration of security controls as part of the organization's overall risk management process.

By executing these top-level actions in your Drupal implementation, you can demonstrate compliance with NIST standards and ensure a secure, reliable governmental web application.
