Absolutely, let's break it down to ensure compliance from a Designer's perspective on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI):

1. **Metadata Development:** 
    - Ensure forms and interfaces include fields for all required metadata: purpose, contact info, authoritative label, etc.
    
2. **Classified and SBU Data Handling:**
    - Integrate tagging mechanisms in the UI to clearly mark data classification (e.g., dropdowns or labels for "Classified" or "SBU").
    - Ensure PII and other sensitive data have clear indicators and appropriate access controls.

3. **Transparency and Accessibility:**
    - Design interfaces that support centralized and transparent data presentation. Use standardized layouts for data storage locations and metadata visibility.
    
4. **Data and Metadata Pairing:**
    - Implement features where data is always displayed/accessible with its corresponding metadata to ensure clarity and context for the user.
    
5. **Documentation and Data Dictionaries:**
    - Create easily navigable interfaces or help sections for data dictionaries and ensure they can be reviewed/updated efficiently.
    
6. **Encryption Indicators:**
    - Include visual indicators or notes in the UI for data that requires encryption keys, ensuring users are aware and have access if needed.
    
7. **Ease of Use:**
    - Ensure that interfaces are intuitive and facilitate easy consultation of data quality programs with clear pathways or links.
    
By aligning your design choices with these actions, your project will better comply with the government standards from your specialized perspective of improving user experience and interface design.
