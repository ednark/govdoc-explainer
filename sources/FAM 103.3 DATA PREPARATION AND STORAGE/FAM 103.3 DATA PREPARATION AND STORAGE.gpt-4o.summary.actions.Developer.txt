Certainly! Here are the minimal actionable steps a Drupal Developer must take to show compliance with the provided Government Standards Document:

1. **Align Data Intake with MRD Standards**:
    - Ensure the data collected and stored aligns with the Department’s Master Reference Data standards (if available).

2. **Develop Metadata**:
    - Collaborate with data users to develop and store metadata for datasets, including purpose, responsible contact information, authoritative label, data sharing agreements (if necessary), encryption keys, and contractual limitations.

3. **Store Data in Raw Format**:
    - Keep data in its most original and raw format.

4. **Classify and Tag Data**:
    - Tag datasets as Classified or Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU), including Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    - Handle classified data according to 5 FAM 480 guidelines and ensure it is not processed on OpenNet.
    - Refer to 12 FAM 540 to identify typical SBU information.

5. **Centralize Data Storage**:
    - Store data and accompanying code in a transparent and centralized location, ensuring both data and its metadata are published together to the bureau’s central repository.

6. **Maintain and Publish Data Dictionaries**:
    - Centralize and publish existing data dictionaries.
    - Review/update data dictionaries every three years or whenever 5% or more of the data changes.

7. **Verify Data Reliability**:
    - Consult the Department’s Data Quality Program, when available, to ensure data reliability.

By following these specific actions, the developer can ensure the web application complies with the relevant parts of the Government Standards Document.
