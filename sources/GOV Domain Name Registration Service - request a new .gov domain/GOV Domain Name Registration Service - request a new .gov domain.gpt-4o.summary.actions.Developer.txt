Certainly! Here is a minimal list of actions for a Drupal developer to show compliance with the .gov domain standards:

1. **Domain Setup:** Ensure the web application's URL uses a .gov domain.
2. **Security Measures:** Implement HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure data exchanged between users and the application.
3. **Accessibility:** Ensure compliance with government accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).
4. **Official Content:** Verify that all public-facing content is accurate and represents official, trusted information.
5. **Domain Management:** Keep the .gov domain records up to date and ensure proper domain registration and renewal.
6. **Government Identification:** Prominently display government logos and disclaimers to identify the site as an official government website.
7. **Data Protection:** Follow federal guidelines for data encryption, storage, and transfer.
8. **SEO Optimization:** Use meta tags and structured data to clearly identify the site to search engines as a government site.
9. **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide clear ways for users to report issues, ensuring accountability and trust.
