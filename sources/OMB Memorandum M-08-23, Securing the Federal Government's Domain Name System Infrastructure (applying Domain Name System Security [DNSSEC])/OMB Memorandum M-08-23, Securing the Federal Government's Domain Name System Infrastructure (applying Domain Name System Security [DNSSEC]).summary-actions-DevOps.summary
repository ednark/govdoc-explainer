To ensure compliance with the DNSSEC standards as outlined in the Government Standards Document for web applications, follow this minimal list of actions:

1. **List All .gov Domains**: Enumerate all second-level .gov domains managed by your agency or on behalf of your agency. 

2. **Identify DNS Service Providers**: Determine whether DNS administration and server operations are handled in-house, outsourced to a commercial provider, or provided by another agency. Identify all relevant stakeholders.

3. **Document DNS Server Infrastructure**: Record details about your DNS server infrastructure, including the provider or source (e.g., BIND, NSD, Microsoft Advanced Directory), and tally the number of servers in use per source.

4. **Address Deployment Barriers**: Identify technical, contractual, or operational barriers that could hinder the deployment of DNSSEC. Set clear milestones for resolving these issues.

5. **Participate in Training and Pilot**: Engage with the USG Secure Naming Infrastructure Pilot and relevant training workshops to understand the practical application and challenges of DNSSEC.

6. **Plan of Action and Milestones**: Develop a comprehensive document outlining your agencyâ€™s steps and timeline to full DNSSEC deployment, including acquisition, training, testing, deployment, and operational planning, with emphasis on protecting citizen services and e-government domains that handle personally identifiable information.

7. **Implement DNSSEC**: Deploy DNSSEC capabilities as outlined, ensuring encryption and securing all DNS communication exchanges to improve integrity and authenticity.

Each of these steps should be completed by December 2009 to align with the policy requirements. Ensure regular updates and compliance checks are included in your plan to meet the proposed deployment timeline efficiently.
