### Summary of Government Standards Document: DNSSEC Implementation

#### Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

1. **DNSSEC Implementation Deadline:**
   - All federal information systems must deploy DNSSEC by December 2009.

2. **NIST Publications:**
   - Follow the recommendations in NIST Special Publication 800-81 “Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide.”
   - Comply with requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-53r1 “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.”
   
3. **Planning and Milestones:**
   - Agencies must develop a plan of action and milestones for DNSSEC deployment, addressing all FISMA information systems by the specified deadline.

4. **Evaluation and Reporting:**
   - Agency progress in DNSSEC deployment will be tracked and evaluated through annual FISMA reporting.

#### Focused Sections: Security, Accessibility, User Experience, and Compliance

- **Security:**
  - DNSSEC provides cryptographic protections, enhancing the security, integrity, and authenticity of DNS communications. Key specific DNSSEC controls like SC-8, SC-20, SC-21, and SC-22 must be followed as described in NIST Special Publication 800-53r1.

- **Accessibility and User Experience:**
  - Implementation of DNSSEC improves the reliability of DNS responses, indirectly enhancing user experience by protecting users from DNS-based attacks.

- **Compliance:**
  - All .gov domains must be DNSSEC signed by the December 2009 deadline. This is essential for compliance with updated federal requirements.

#### Condensed Summary

1. **Deadline Compliance:**
   - Complete DNSSEC deployment across all federal information systems by December 2009.

2. **Security Enhancement:**
   - Implement DNSSEC as per NIST SP 800-81 and SP 800-53r1 to secure DNS communications.

3. **Monitor and Report:**
   - Develop a detailed action plan, track progress, and report annually via FISMA on DNSSEC implementation.

This summary focuses on the urgent need for DNSSEC implementation to ensure the security and integrity of DNS communications within federal information systems, according to specified guidelines and deadlines laid out by NIST and the OMB memorandum.
