### Summary of Government Standards Document: Securing Federal Government’s Domain Name System

#### Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements:

1. **Deployment of DNSSEC**:
   - All federal information systems must deploy Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) by December 2009.
   - This includes cryptographic protections for DNS, enhancing the integrity and authenticity of Internet communications.

2. **NIST Publications**:
   - Agencies must follow specifications from NIST Special Publication 800-81 “Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide.”
   - Compliance with security controls stated in NIST Special Publication 800-53r1 “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems” is mandatory.

3. **Action and Milestones Planning**:
   - Agencies are required to develop and submit a plan of action and milestones by September 2008, with secure deployment of DNSSEC to all their applicable systems.
   - Final plans will be agreed upon by October 2008.

4. **Domain and DNS Server Documentation**:
   - Agencies must document and enumerate .gov domains they operate.
   - They must also identify sources of DNS services and describe their DNS server infrastructure.

5. **Identification and Elimination of Barriers**:
   - Agencies need to document technical, contractual, or operational barriers to DNSSEC deployment and outline solutions.

6. **Training and Pilot Testing**:
   - Agencies should engage in pilot testing through the US Government’s Secure Naming Infrastructure Pilot, and plan training activities.

7. **Comprehensive Compliance Reporting**:
   - Deployment progress of DNSSEC will be tracked and evaluated through annual FISMA reporting.

#### Sections Focusing on Key Aspects:

- **Security**: Entire document with primary emphasis on DNSSEC deployment, as mentioned in multiple sections detailing mandatory cryptographic security enhancements and barriers to secure deployment.
- **Accessibility and User Experience**: Not directly addressed in terms of web accessibility or user interface but focuses on securing the DNS infrastructure which indirectly supports user trust and accessibility to government services.
- **Compliance**: Highlighted through required adherence to NIST publications and the outlined steps for DNSSEC deployment, with reporting through FISMA.

#### Concise Summary:

- The document mandates federal agencies to implement DNSSEC across all information systems by December 2009 to secure DNS communications, following guidelines from NIST publications. Agencies must document their .gov domains, DNS services, and server infrastructure. They need to develop a detailed action plan with milestones for DNSSEC deployment, identify any deployment barriers, engage in training, and participate in pilot testing. Compliance and progress will be monitored via annual FISMA reports.
