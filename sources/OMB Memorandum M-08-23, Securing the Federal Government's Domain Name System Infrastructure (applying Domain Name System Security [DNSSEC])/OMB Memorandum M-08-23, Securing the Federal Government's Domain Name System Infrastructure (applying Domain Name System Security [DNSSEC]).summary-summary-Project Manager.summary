Summary of Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements:
  
1. **DNS Security Implementation (DNSSEC)**
   - All Federal information systems must deploy DNSSEC by December 2009.
   - Deployment must follow NIST Special Publication 800-81 “Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide.”
   - Full DNSSEC signing of the .gov domain at the top level has been mandated by January 2009.
   - Each agency is required to develop a plan of action with milestones for DNSSEC integration across all applicable information systems.

2. **Security Controls and Compliance**
   - Follow recommendations and procedures outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-53r1 for security controls.
   - Requires expansion to include all FISMA information systems.
  
3. **Plan of Action and Maturity**
   - Agencies must submit a draft plan detailing DNSSEC implementation milestones by September 5, 2008.
   - Plans to be reviewed and finalised by October 24, 2008, with deployment completion expected by December 2009.

4. **Resources and Documentation**
   - Utilize resources such as the USG DNSSEC deployment email list, the DNSSEC Deployment Initiative website, and the Secure Naming Infrastructure Pilot (SNIP).

5. **Training and Pilot Testing**
   - Agencies are expected to participate in the Secure Naming Infrastructure Pilot and engage in related training workshops.
  
**Focus on Security, Accessibility, User Experience, and Compliance:**
- **Security:** Through the mandatory deployment of DNSSEC, security of .gov domains against DNS-related attacks is a primary focus.
- **Compliance:** Compliance with set timelines and deployment guidelines as per NIST publications is mandatory.
- **User Experience is implied in the overall integrity and authenticity of internet resources accessed via .gov domains, improved through DNSSEC.**

**Concise Summary:**
- Deploy DNSSEC across all Federal systems by December 2009 using guidelines from NIST Special Publication 800-81.
- Ensure compliance with security control recommendations from NIST Special Publication 800-53r1.
- Submit and finalize plans following specific milestones and deadlines for DNSSEC deployment and use provided resources for support and training.
