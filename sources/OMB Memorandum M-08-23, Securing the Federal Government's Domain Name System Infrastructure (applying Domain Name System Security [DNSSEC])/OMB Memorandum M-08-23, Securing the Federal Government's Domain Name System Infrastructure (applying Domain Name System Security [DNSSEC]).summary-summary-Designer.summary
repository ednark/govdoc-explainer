# Summary Document for User Experience and User Interface Regarding Government Standards on DNSSEC Deployment

## Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

1. **DNSSEC Deployment Requirement**: 
   - Federal agencies are required to deploy Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNS, or DNSSEC) across all their .gov domains by December 2008.
   - This includes ensuring cryptographic protections designed to secure DNS communications and increase the authenticity and integrity of information exchanged over the internet.

2. **Compliance with NIST Standards**:
   - Agencies must adhere to guidelines outlined in the NIST Special Publication 800-53r1 with a specific emphasis on DNSSEC controls and deployment steps that are also detailed in NIST Special Publication 800-81.
   - Future updates and expanded coverage of DNSSEC protocols will conform to revisions in the stated NIST publications.

## Specific Standards Focusing On Security and Compliance

- **Secure DNS Setup**:
  - The top level .gov domain must be DNSSEC signed by January 2009, ensuring a secure foundation for sub-domains.
  - Each agency must develop a comprehensive strategy for DNSSEC deployment following guidelines from NIST publications, especially those which cater directly to security protocols such as SC-8, SC-20, SC-21, and SC-22.

- **Plan of Action & Milestones**:
  - Agencies must create and document a DNSSEC deployment plan by following a specific template that includes listing domains, identifying DNS service sources, describing DNS server infrastructure, and outlining the perceived barriers and respective milestones.

## Highlighted Focus Areas

### Security
- Agents should implement and operate DNSSEC, which provides essential cryptographic protections to thwart DNS-based information breaches. 

### Compliance
- Compliance with standards primarily from NIST is necessary to guide the deployment and operational processes of DNSSEC, ensuring secure and effective implementations.

### User Experience/Interface (Implied)
- While not directly mentioned, securing the DNS architecture indirectly supports better user experiences by ensuring the reliability and authenticity of the system, which users depend on for secure and consistent internet access.

## Simplified Overall Summary
- Federal agencies are mandated to securely implement DNSSEC for all .gov domains by December 2008, as per specific guidelines from NIST publications. This aims to enhance DNS communication security, making internet-based services more reliable and trustworthy for users. Agencies need to prepare detailed deployment plans, ensuring compliance with these standards, while indirectly promoting a safer user experience.
