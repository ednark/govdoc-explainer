To ensure compliance with the DNSSEC deployment standards as outlined in the government memorandum, as a Project Manager, you need to undertake the following actions:

1. **Inventory Domains**: Enumerate all .gov second-level domains operated by or on behalf of your agency.

2. **Identify DNS Service Providers**: For each domain, determine whether DNS services are managed in-house, outsourced to commercial providers, or facilitated by another agency.

3. **Document DNS Server Infrastructure**: List down all DNS server implementations (e.g., BIND, NSD, Microsoft Advanced Directory) used within your agency. Include an estimate of how many servers are operated per each type.

4. **Identify and Address Deployment Barriers**: Document any technical, contractual, or operational barriers that may impede the deployment of DNSSEC. Establish and note milestones for resolving these barriers.

5. **Arrange for Training and Pilot Tests**: Engage with the activities of the USG Secure Naming Infrastructure Pilot. Plan participation in training workshops and pilot testing to validate the deployment strategies and practical implementations.

6. **Develop a Comprehensive DNSSEC Action Plan**: Create a detailed plan of action and milestones (POA&M) that aligns with the policies outlined in the memorandum. This plan should include activities and timelines for procurement, training, testing, deployment, and operational management, with a focus on securing domains that handle personally identifiable information.

7. **Regular Reporting and Review**: Prepare for regular updates and feedback mechanisms including submission of plans and reporting on the progress as required for FISMA evaluations and compliance audits.

By systematically following these steps, you will align your project with the requirements mandated by the government for DNSSEC deployment within the .gov domain space.
