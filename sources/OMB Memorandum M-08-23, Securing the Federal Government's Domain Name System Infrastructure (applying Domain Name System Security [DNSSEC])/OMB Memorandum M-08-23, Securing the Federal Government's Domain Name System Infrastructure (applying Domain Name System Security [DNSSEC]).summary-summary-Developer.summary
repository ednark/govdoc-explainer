**Summary of Government Standards Document for Drupal Backend Development**

**1. Primary Standards and Guidelines**
   - **DNSSEC Deployment**: All Federal information systems must deploy Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) by December 2009. This includes all .gov domains under each agency's control.
   - **Compliance Standards**: Follow the recommendations in NIST Special Publication 800-81 “Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide” and ensure all DNS actions adhere to NIST Special Publication 800-53r1 “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.”

**2. Security Focused Sections**
   - **DNSSEC Implementation**: Secure DNS communications to enhance integrity and authenticity, mitigating DNS-based attacks.
   - **Plan of Action and Milestones**: Documenting DNSSEC deployment specifics, identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities and compliance levels.

**3. Compliance with Standards**
   - **Deadline Compliance**: All .gov domains must be DNSSEC signed by the specified implementation deadline of December 2009.
   - **Reporting**: Ongoing compliance and progress will be tracked via annual Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) reporting.

**4. Accessibility, User Experience and Compliance**
   - While the memorandum primarily focuses on security, the implied goal of DNSSEC—to enhance the trustworthiness of .gov domains—also indirectly supports better user experience by ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the website.

**Simplified Summary**
   - Implement DNSSEC for all .gov domains under your control by December 2009, following NIST guidelines in publications 800-81 and 800-53r1.
   - Develop and document an action plan detailing DNSSEC implementation milestones, addressing any deployment barriers.
   - Compliance and progress in DNSSEC implementation will be monitored annually through FISMA. 

This concise approach aligns with the development requisites for Drupal backend, focusing on security enhancements via DNSSEC to bolster the overall infrastructure of your .gov domains.
