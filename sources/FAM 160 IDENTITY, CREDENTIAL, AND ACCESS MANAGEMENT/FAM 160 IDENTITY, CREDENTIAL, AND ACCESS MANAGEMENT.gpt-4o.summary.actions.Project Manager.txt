To ensure compliance with the Department’s standards for a web application project, a Project Manager should focus on tracking and organizing the following key actions:

1. **Ensure Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**:
   - Implement SSO for user authentication into the web application.

2. **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Require MFA for users accessing the web application.

3. **Adhere to Identity Governance**:
   - Maintain and manage digital identities and associated privileges throughout the user lifecycle.

4. **Compliance with Federal Directives**:
   - Confirm compliance with relevant Executive Orders, OMB Memorandums, NIST standards, and FISMA requirements.

5. **Establish Secure Access Management**:
   - Ensure all access requests are securely managed and validated, following SE-ICAM protocols.

6. **Restrict Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Collection**:
   - Limit PII collection to what is legally authorized and necessary for accurate identification.

7. **Integrate Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) Capabilities**:
   - Implement CDM tools to monitor and enhance security posture.

8. **Implement Master User Record (MUR)**:
   - Use MUR to store and manage core personal data attributes effectively.

9. **Enforce Zero Trust Architecture**:
   - Validate users' identities and require necessary credentials and privileges for system access.

10. **Use State Global Identifier (SGID)**:
    - Assign SGID to users to protect against identity fraud and enhance privacy.

11. **Ensure Policies and Procedures Are Followed**:
    - Develop and implement policies guiding ICAM activities and ensure adherence throughout the project.

12. **Use Commercially Available Products**:
    - Deploy ICAM capabilities using commercially available solutions, leveraging open APIs for interoperability.
    
13. **Isolate Physical and Logical Access**:
    - Implement controls to isolate physical and logical access to the system as per SE-ICAM requirements.

By consistently tracking these actions, a Project Manager can guide the team and clients towards achieving compliance with the Department’s standards for web applications.
