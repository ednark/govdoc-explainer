Sure! Here's a minimal list of actions that a DevOps technician must take to ensure compliance with the standards for a web application project:

1. **Implement Single Sign-On (SSO)**
   - Integrate SSO to allow users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple related applications.

2. **Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Configure MFA to ensure users provide two or more pieces of evidence for authentication.

3. **Identity Governance**
   - Employ identity governance solutions to manage user identities and associated privileges throughout their lifecycle.

4. **Use Federated Identity Management**
   - Leverage existing Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials and identity federations.

5. **Implement Zero Trust Architecture**
   - Ensure that the system validates user privileges, credentials, and security training status.

6. **Deploy Compliance Monitoring Solutions**
   - Integrate continuous diagnostic and mitigation (CDM) tools to monitor and mitigate security risks.

7. **Establish Master User Record (MUR)**
   - Set up a Master User Record system to compile user attributes and ensure data accuracy and consistency.

8. **Use State Global Identifier (SGID)**
   - Implement SGIDs to replace the use of Social Security Numbers (SSN) and protect privacy.

9. **Compliance with NIST Standards**
   - Ensure that all deployed products and services conform to NIST Special Publications (SP), especially SP 800-63 series.

10. **Maintain Secure Infrastructure**
    - Isolate physical and logical access to systems, ensuring authorized access, firewall restrictions, and compliance with SE-ICAM System Security Plan (SSP).

11. **Leverage Cloud Capabilities**
    - Use cloud infrastructure for deploying SE-ICAM solutions and ensure only authenticated users access the systems.

12. **Restrict PII Collection**
    - Limit the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to what is legally authorized and necessary.

Following these actions will align the DevOps infrastructure with the government standards and ensure compliance for the web application project.
