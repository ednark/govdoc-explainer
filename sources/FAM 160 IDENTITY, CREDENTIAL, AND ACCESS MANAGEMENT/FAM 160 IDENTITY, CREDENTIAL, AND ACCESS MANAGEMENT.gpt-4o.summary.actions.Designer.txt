Certainly, here is a minimal list of actions for ensuring compliance with standards from the perspective of a Designer:

1. **Implement Single Sign-On (SSO):** Incorporate SSO in the UI to allow users to log in once and access multiple related systems seamlessly.

2. **Integrate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Design UI elements that prompt users to provide multiple forms of authentication (e.g., password and biometric).

3. **Follow User Access Lifecycle:** Ensure that UI designs include features for user registration, profile management, password resets, and account deactivation aligned with lifecycle management practices.

4. **Design for Identity Governance:** Create UI components that allow users to view and manage their credentials and permissions, ensuring transparency and ease of access management.

5. **Ensure Privacy and Security Compliance:** Incorporate notifications and consent forms to inform users about data collection, use, and storage, adhering to PII and other privacy standards.

6. **Accessibility and Usability:** Make sure the UI meets usability standards and is accessible, following guidelines to accommodate all users, including those with disabilities.

7. **Integration with Master User Record (MUR):** Design UI components to display and update user attributes securely, as required by the MUR.

8. **Compliance with SGID Requirements:** Do not display sensitive information like Social Security Numbers; use State Global Identifiers (SGID) in UI to enhance privacy and security.

9. **Continuous Authentication Monitoring:** Include UI elements that dynamically request re-authentication during high-risk activities.

10. **User Training Indicators:** Design interfaces that show completion of required security training or remind users to complete necessary security training for access.

By implementing these actions, the Designer ensures the web application adheres to government standards concerning identity, credential, and access management.
