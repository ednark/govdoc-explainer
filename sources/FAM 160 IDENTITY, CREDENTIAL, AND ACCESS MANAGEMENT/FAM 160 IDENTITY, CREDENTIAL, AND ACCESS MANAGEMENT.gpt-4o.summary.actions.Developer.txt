To ensure compliance with the standards in a web application built on Drupal, a developer should take the following minimal list of actions:

1. **Implement Single Sign-On (SSO):** Use a Drupal module that integrates with the Departmentâ€™s ICAM SSO solution.
2. **Enable Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):** Configure MFA using a Drupal module that supports token-based or biometric authentication.
3. **Integrate with SE-ICAM API:** Ensure the web application interacts with SE-ICAM using open APIs for identity governance and access management.
4. **Use PIV Credentials:** Configure the system to accept Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials for authentication.
5. **Ensure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement role-based permissions to control access based on user roles defined by the department.
6. **Log Access and Changes:** Maintain audit trails of access and changes to data within the application.
7. **Encrypt PII Data:** Ensure encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) both in transit and at rest.
8. **Validate User Training:** Verify users have completed necessary security training before granting access.
9. **Limit PII Collection:** Collect only the PII deemed necessary for user identification and adhere to legal requirements.
10. **Implement Master User Record (MUR):** Map user accounts to the Master User Record (MUR) and ensure data consistency.
11. **Support Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM):** Integrate any CDM tools required for monitoring and responding to security incidents.
12. **Adhere to Zero Trust Principles:** Validate user identity and authenticated sessions before granting access to resources.
13. **Test for Compliance:** Regularly test the web application for compliance with security controls and standards.

By focusing on these actions, a Drupal developer can effectively ensure that the web application aligns with the specified government standards for identity, credential, and access management.
