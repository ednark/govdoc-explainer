From the perspective of a Drupal developer tasked with implementing backend business logic for a web application while ensuring compliance with DoD 4400.1-M, below is a minimal list of actions that should be taken on a project:

1. **Understand Priority Ratings**:
   - Identify whether the contract/project has a DX or DO priority rating.

2. **Data Security and Privacy**:
   - Ensure that all data handling and storage conforms to classified information guidelines if applicable.

3. **Urgency Deadlines**:
   - Implement features to ensure that any changes or updates are rolled out according to required delivery dates.

4. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Integrate logging mechanisms to maintain accurate records of transactions pertinent to priority orders for at least 3 years.

5. **Access Control**:
   - Secure access levels within Drupal to ensure only authorized personnel can modify or access certain data and functionalities.

6. **Compliance Checks**:
   - Implement automated checks to ensure that all operations comply with the DPAS requirements specific to the project.

7. **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**:
   - Build features to identify and resolve conflicts in resource allocation within the web applicationâ€™s project management tools.

8. **Special Priorities Assistance (SPA) Requests**:
   - Implement systems for contractors to submit SPA requests (such as special forms like BXA-999) electronically if needed for production or delivery issues.

9. **Production Scheduling**:
   - Develop workflow management tools within Drupal that can handle revisions and rescheduling of tasks and deliveries to meet priority requirements.

10. **Audit Trails**:
   - Ensure that the web application has capabilities to conduct internal audits and compliance reviews.

From the developer's perspective, these actions focus on making sure that the web application you are working on aligns with critical DoD standards, particularly around handling urgency and priority in project deliverables, securing sensitive information, maintaining compliance, and facilitating necessary communications.
