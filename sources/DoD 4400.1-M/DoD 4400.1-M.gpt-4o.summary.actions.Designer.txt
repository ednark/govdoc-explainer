Sure! Here is a minimal list of actions a designer specializing in Human-Centered Design (HCD) should consider for compliance with government standards, focusing specifically on the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) aspects of a web application:

1. **Accessibility Compliance**:
   - Ensure web content meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
   - Include alt text for all images.
   - Ensure color contrast ratios are sufficient.

2. **User Privacy**:
   - Design clear and detailed privacy policy pages.
   - Provide easy access to privacy settings and consent forms.
   - Ensure forms and data collection mechanisms are designed to obtain informed consent.

3. **Usability Testing**:
   - Conduct regular usability testing with diverse user groups, including people with disabilities.
   - Implement iterative design changes based on user feedback.

4. **Consistent Navigation**:
   - Design a consistent and intuitive navigation structure.
   - Ensure all navigation elements are accessible through multiple input methods (e.g., keyboard navigation).

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the application is fully responsive across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Optimize UI elements to function effectively at different screen sizes and orientations.

6. **Security Notices**:
   - Clearly design and place security and error notices.
   - Ensure users understand data security practices (e.g., secure login procedures).

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Design friendly and informative error messages.
   - Provide guidance to users on how to correct input errors.

8. **User Feedback and Assistance**:
   - Implement feedback mechanisms for users to report issues or provide suggestions.
   - Design and integrate a comprehensive help section, FAQs, and live support options.

9. **Compliance Documentation**:
   - Maintain design documentation clearly showing how the UX/UI complies with relevant standards.
   - Regularly update documentation to reflect any changes or improvements.

10. **Training and Awareness**:
    - Participate in ongoing training about government standards and HCD best practices.
    - Ensure that all design decisions are communicated and justified with adherence to these standards.

By adhering to these actions, designers can ensure that they are covering essential compliance aspects relevant to their role in the development of web applications for government contracts.
