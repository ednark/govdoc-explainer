C1.  CHAPTER 1
GENERAL INFORMATION
C1.1.  REISSUANCE AND PURPOSE. 
Under the authority of DoD Directive 4400.1 (reference (a)), this Manual updates the 
operating guidelines that the DoD Components and Associated Agencies use to 
implement the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) (15 CFR 700) 
(reference (b)).
C1.2.  POLICY 
Classification.   The Department of Defense's list of DX-rated programs is unclassified.
C1.3.  APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE 
C1.3.1.  Authority to require priority performance of contracts and orders under 
the Defense Production Act (DPA) (reference (c)) and the statutes listed at reference 
(d), for industrial services, has been delegated to the Department of Commerce (DoC).   
To implement this authority, the DoC is responsible for developing, coordinating, 
administering, and enforcing the DPAS regulation (reference (b)).   The DoC has 
authorized the Department of Defense to apply priority ratings to contracts and orders 
that support the DoD-approved national defense program categories in DPAS Schedule 
1.
C1.3.2.  This Manual:
C1.3.2.1.  Implements the DPAS for the Department of Defense.   It is not a 
guide for industry.   Users also shall become familiar with reference (b).
C1.3.2.2.  References DD Form 691, "DoD Application for Priority rating for 
Production or Construction Equipment," and DoC Form BXA-999, "Request for Special 
Priorities Assistance."   Electronic versions of these forms are preferable.   The DoD 
forms and DoC forms referred to in this Manual are available on the Internet under

ABBREVIATIONS AND/OR ACRONYMS
C1.4.  AUTHORITIES AND LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND 
C1.4.1.  Congress enacted the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. 
2061, et seq.) (reference (c)) to help ensure, among other measures, that products, 
materials, and services needed for defense are expeditiously available.   Title I of the 
Act, entitled "Priorities and Allocations," authorizes the President to:
C1.4.1.1.  Require that certain defense and energy contracts and orders be 
performed on a priority basis.
C1.4.1.2.  Allocate materials, services, and facilities to promote the national 
defense.
C1.4.2.  Although Congress has revised the DPA many times, the basic intent of 
Title I and its implementing regulations remains the same, namely to help keep current 
defense and energy programs on schedule and to provide a framework for rapid 
industrial response in a national emergency.
C1.4.3.  Should the authority of the DPA expire, Section 18 of the Selective 
Service Act (SSA) (50 U.S.C. App. 468) (reference (d)) and other authorities listed in 
Executive Order 12742 (reference (e)) authorize the Government to obtain articles or 
materials from contractors promptly and exclusively for the U.S. Armed Forces.

C2.  CHAPTER 2
AUTHORITIES, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND FUNCTIONS
C2.1.  AUTHORITIES 
C2.1.1.  Title I of the DPA authorizes the President to:

other contracts and orders.
C2.1.1.2.  Allocate materials, services, and facilities to promote approved 
programs for the national defense.
C2.1.2.  Section 18 of the SSA (reference (d)) authorizes the Government to obtain 
priority delivery of articles or materials exclusively for the Armed Forces of the United 
States.   This applies to any person operating a plant, mine, or other facility that can 
produce similar quantities of these materials.
C2.1.3.  There are other authorities listed in Executive Order 12742 (reference (e)) 
that provide priority for contracts and orders of the Armed Forces.
C2.2.  DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY 
C2.2.1.  To carry out priority authorities, the President, by Executive Orders 
(references (e) and (f)) has delegated Priorities and Allocations (P&A) authority for 
industrial resources (articles, materials, including construction materials, services, and 
facilities) to the Secretary of Commerce to support approved national defense 
programs.
C2.2.2.  The DoC implements its P&A authority by issuing, administering, and 
enforcing the DPAS Regulation 15 CFR 700 (reference (b)).   The Secretary of 
Commerce has redelegated authority under the DPAS to the Secretary of Defense to 
rate contracts and orders that support national defense programs the Department of

CHAPTER 2
C3.  CHAPTER 3
APPROVED PROGRAMS
C3.1.  GENERAL 
C3.1.1.  The DPAS is largely self-executing.   The Department of Defense obtains 
priority performance of defense contracts and orders when an authorized Government 
PCO makes the contract a "rated order" by:
C3.1.1.1.  Placing a priority rating in the appropriate block on the face of the 
contract or purchase order;
C3.1.1.2.  Specifying required delivery dates;
C3.1.1.3.  Adding the statement in 15 CFR 700.12(d) (reference (b)); and
C3.1.1.4.  Signing the contract or purchase order.
C3.1.2.  In turn, DPAS requires prime contractors to extend the priority rating to 
lower tier contractors and suppliers, making all these contracts and orders "rated orders."
C3.2.  DETERMINING IF A CONTRACT MAY BE RATED 
C3.2.1.  Procuring Activities shall assign a priority rating to all defense contracts 
and purchase orders, except when 15 CFR 700.18 (reference (b)) prohibits this, or if 
they contain items the DoC excludes in DPAS Delegation 1, including:
C3.2.1.1.  Items that will not be production material for an approved program.
C3.2.1.2.  Civilian items or their packaging for military exchanges.
C3.2.1.3.  Any end items that:
C3.2.1.3.1.  Are commonly available in commercial markets, including 
retail establishments;
C3.2.1.3.2.  Require minimal modification for approved program use; and
C3.2.1.3.3.  Are readily available for approved program requirements.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
17
CHAPTER 3
C3.2.1.4.  Items that are primarily for administrative purposes, such as for 
personnel or financial management.
C3.2.1.5.  Any items that do not directly support logistics, tactical, or 
operational program requirements, such as word processing equipment and furniture.
C3.2.1.6.  Liaison vehicles, including passenger aircraft and cars.
C3.2.1.7.  Personal items of clothing and equipment, such as T-shirts, insignia, 
and unauthorized personal items.
C3.2.1.8.  Items that support or enhance chemical or biological warfare 
capabilities unless the President or Secretary of Defense directly authorizes them.   
However, items that defend against or provide protection from chemical or biological 
attack may receive a priority rating.
C3.2.2.  Also apply the following restrictions to ratings when purchasing computer 
systems and/or peripheral equipment:
C3.2.2.1.  Procuring Activities shall assign priority ratings only when the 
computer system and/or peripheral equipment will be integral to an end item that is 
necessary for:
C3.2.2.1.1.  Strategic or tactical military operations.
C3.2.2.1.2.  Logistics support of military operations.
C3.2.2.1.3.  Research and development (R&D), production, testing, or 
construction at Government-owned facilities.
C3.2.2.2.  Defense contractors shall use DD Form 691 (see Chapter 4) to 
request priority ratings for acquiring computers and peripheral equipment as privately 
owned capital.   The DPAS officer shall grant the request once the Administrative 
Contracting Officer (ACO) and PCO thoroughly evaluate it to ensure the equipment:
C3.2.2.2.1.  Is for defense-related R&D, production, or construction (i.e., 
computer-aided design, testing, production control);
C3.2.2.2.2.  Is necessary to ensure timely deliveries on priority-rated 
defense contracts and purchase orders for approved programs; and
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
18
CHAPTER 3
C3.2.2.2.3.  Has the smallest capacity available to meet all 
defense-related requirements sufficiently.
C3.2.2.3.  Procuring Activities shall not assign priority ratings for equipment 
when they:
C3.2.2.3.1.  Finance it with nonappropriated funds.
C3.2.2.3.2.  Use the equipment primarily for administrative or business 
purposes, such as financial management, insurance programs, commissary or base 
exchange operations, or personnel, education, and training programs.
C3.3.  SELECTING THE CORRECT PRIORITY RATING 
C3.3.1.  Follow 15 CFR 700.11 (reference (b)) to select the correct priority 
rating.   Apply a DO rating to all contracts and purchase orders supporting DO-rated 
programs.   Apply the DX rating to all contracts and purchase orders supporting an 
authorized DX program.
C3.3.1.1.  A DX rating may support portions of a DO-rated program when:
C3.3.1.1.1.  An end item or component from a DO-rated Program is 
necessary to directly support the DX-rated program's schedule; and
C3.3.1.1.2.  The scheduled delivery of an item for a DO-rated program will 
not satisfy the DX program requirements.
C3.3.1.2.  The DO-rated program's program office shall, when appropriate, 
obtain a statement from the DX-rated program office confirming the DX rating and 
required delivery dates for the DO-rated program item(s).   They also shall follow DPAS 
regulation requirements to distinguish between DX- and DO-rated items on each 
contract or purchase order.
C3.3.2.  Select the appropriate program identification symbol from DPAS Schedule 
1 (included in reference (b)).   Use only program identification symbols for which the 
Department of Defense is shown as a "Delegate Agency."
C3.3.3.  Select the program symbol that best covers the items to be acquired.   For 
example, a contract for:
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
19
CHAPTER 3
C3.3.3.1.  Aircraft engines shall use "A1," for missiles "A2," for miscellaneous 
"C9."
C3.3.3.2.  Furnishing production equipment that the Government intends to 
own shall use "B9."
C3.3.4.  Select the most specific program symbol if choosing among more than 
one is possible.   For example, a contract for:
C3.3.4.1.  Aircraft using "A1" also applies to all contractor-furnished 
equipment including electronics.
C3.3.4.2.  Government-furnished electronic equipment to go into the aircraft 
uses "A7."
C3.4.  OBTAINING RATING AUTHORITY FOR ITEMS LIMITED BY 15 CFR 700.18 
C3.4.1.  15 CFR 700.18(a) (reference (b)) addresses general limitations on placing 
rated orders.   According to DPAS section 700.18(b), DPAS does not apply to items 
under the authority of other Agencies and, therefore, outside of DoC authority.   
Following are procedures for authorizing priority ratings for items that reference (b) 
covers.
C3.4.2.  Rating Orders for Production and Construction Equipment 
C3.4.2.1.  Persons delegated authority according to section C2.3. may 
authorize priority ratings for:
C3.4.2.1.1.  Production equipment necessary to support approved DoD 
programs and complete the rated orders on time, and that cannot otherwise be delivered 
on time.
C3.4.2.1.2.  Construction equipment for approved DoD construction 
projects that cannot otherwise be delivered on time.
C3.4.2.2.  Contractors may submit a DD Form 691 to obtain priority ratings 
for production or construction equipment to the CAO DPAS Officer, who shall:
C3.4.2.2.1.  Initially review it and concur or nonconcur.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
20
CHAPTER 3
C3.4.2.2.2.  Forward this recommendation to the procuring activity DPAS 
Officer or the person he or she delegates.
C3.4.2.3.  The procuring activity DPAS Officer or his or her delegate shall 
approve DD Form 691 if he or she determines that:
C3.4.2.3.1.  Similar equipment in the contractor's plant for orders is not 
available.
C3.4.2.3.2.  Rated defense contracts would be delayed if he or she 
disapproved the form.
C3.4.2.3.3.  Overtime hours on critical machine operations would not 
solve the capacity deficiency.
C3.4.2.4.  If it meets the requirements, the procuring activity DPAS Officer or 
authorized delegate forwards the approved DD Form 691, which shall designate whether 
the priority rating is a DO or DX rating, to the contractor via the CAO DPAS Officer.   
The highest program rating that the equipment supports determines the rating level.
C3.4.2.5.  Production equipment eligible for priority ratings include:
C3.4.2.5.1.  Machine controls and devices.
C3.4.2.5.2.  Scientific instruments and equipment necessary for research 
and development.
C3.4.2.5.3.  Tools, jigs, dies, fixtures, and major repair parts necessary to 
fulfill a defense contract if the items cannot be rated as maintenance, repair, and 
operation supplies.
C3.4.2.5.4.  Equipment for service contractors that supports approved 
programs, whether or not the service contract itself is rated.
C3.4.2.5.5.  Computer systems and peripheral equipment for 
defense-related research and development, production, testing, or construction purposes 
(i.e., computer-aided design, testing, production process control).
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
21
CHAPTER 3
C3.4.2.6.  The DUSD(IP) must approve, in writing, and authorize any priority 
rating that a defense contractor uses to acquire a "super computer."   Super computers 
comprise computer equipment and peripherals that are comparable (within 10 percent) 
to the fastest machines available for general use.
C3.4.2.7.  Contractors may use, without separate DPAS officer authorization, a 
priority rating for production equipment, including acquiring and installing it, that is part 
of a construction project for which a priority rating already has been authorized.
C3.4.2.8.  Refer borderline cases and requests for exceptions or further 
guidance on these policies to higher headquarters on a case-by-case basis.
C3.4.3.  Requesting Rating Authority Before Receiving a Rated Prime Contract 
C3.4.3.1.  15 CFR 700.51(c) (reference (b)) authorizes a person to request a 
priority rating for orders before actually receiving a rated order.   The person requesting 
such a rating shall submit their request to the PCO according to 15 CFR 700.51(c)(2) 
(reference (b)) and support it by responding to the criteria in 15 CFR 700.51(c)(3) 
(reference (b)).
C3.4.3.2.  The PCO shall send a request for SPA, according to internal 
instructions, to the cognizant operating DPAS officer, who shall review and act on the 
request according to Chapter 5 of this Manual.
C3.4.4.  Refer to Chapter 7 for procedures on rating authority for coproduction and 
other international defense programs.
C3.4.5.  Rating Authority for Other Items Under DoC Jurisdiction 
C3.4.5.1.  DoC may authorize priority ratings for any items that cannot receive 
a priority rating under 15 CFR 700.18(b)(3) (reference (b)).   Persons requesting ratings 
on these items shall:
C3.4.5.1.1.  Document that they:
C3.4.5.1.1.1.  Need the items for timely performance of rated orders.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
22
CHAPTER 3
C3.4.5.1.1.2.  Cannot otherwise obtain timely delivery of the items.
C3.4.5.1.2.  Submit this justification with the Request for Special 
Priorities Assistance (Form BXA-999) and DoD sponsorship to the DoC.   (See Chapter 
5.)

CONSTRUCTION
C4.1.  GENERAL 
C4.1.1.  This chapter provides special procedures for approved construction 
projects.
C4.1.2.  Construction equipment includes any type of construction machinery and 
equipment.   Figure C4.F1. lists examples.
C4.2.  PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS 
The DoD Operating Element shall use the "C2" program identification symbol when 
authorizing construction contractors to use a priority rating to acquire:
C4.2.1.  Production equipment for the completed construction project.
C4.2.2.  Construction machinery and equipment to be used as production equipment 
in the completed construction project.
C4.2.3.  Installation materials.
C4.3.  CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT FOR OFFSHORE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS 
C4.3.1.  "Offshore" includes all areas not within the United States, its territories, or 
possessions.
C4.3.2.  The DoD Component and Associated Agencies may authorize U.S., 
Canadian, or other construction contractors to use a DO or DX priority rating to 
purchase construction equipment in the United States for offshore use on approved DoD 
construction projects under the same procedures and actions applicable to U.S. 
construction projects.
C4.3.3.  Canadian or other foreign construction contractors shall apply for priority 
rating according to Chapter 7.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
24
CHAPTER 4
C4.4.  MILITARY HOUSING 
All military and family housing on or off military bases and reservations, including 
housing addressed in Title VIII of the National Housing Act, is the Department of 
Defense's responsibility.   Construction of these facilities is part of the DoD 
Construction Program, and they may receive priority ratings as provided in this chapter.
C4.5.  PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION CASES 
C4.5.1.  The Department of Defense may only use P&A authority for construction 
in Government-financed programs such as the "C2-approved" program.   However, some 
construction projects that are normally not eligible for a priority rating may be 
important enough to receive one.   The DoC authorizes priority ratings for private 
industrial expansion and may assign the DX or DO rating symbol to construction 
projects.
C4.5.2.  The DoD Components and Associated Agencies may use Form BXA-999 
(see Chapter 5) to sponsor applications for privately financed industrial expansion 
projects, in which their programs have direct interest, for priority rating authority, 
through the DUSD(IP), to the DoC.   To do so, they must meet these criteria:
C4.5.2.1.  The proposed facility will remedy or help to remedy an actual or 
potential shortage of facilities to produce needed items or to provide needed services.
C4.5.2.2.  The proposed facility will supply items or services that support 
approved DoD programs.
C4.5.2.3.  The priority rating is necessary to finish building the facility 
according to the proposed or established schedule.

SPECIAL PRIORITIES ASSISTANCE
C5.1  GENERAL 
When defense prime contracts are properly rated, and the priority ratings are properly 
extended (15 CFR 700.15) (reference (b)) to the lowest level subcontractor and vendor, 
the preferential scheduling provisions of DPAS (15 CFR 700.14) (reference (b)) 
generally are self-executing.   Occasionally, however, Government buying activities, 
prime contractors, subcontractors, and other suppliers may need assistance in obtaining 
timely deliveries or authority to use priority ratings on orders for items not normally 
ratable.   15 CFR 700.50 through 700.55 (reference (b)) outlines the basic SPA 
provisions.
C5.2.  TYPES OF ASSISTANCE 
While persons can request SPA for any reason to support the DPAS, they usually 
receive SPA when they:
C5.2.1.  Are having difficulty obtaining a rated order by the required delivery date at 
any level of the supply chain such as prime contractor, subcontractor, or vendor.
C5.2.2.  Want to accelerate the delivery of a rated order due to a change in the 
military urgency and the supplier cannot comply because of other rated orders.
C5.2.3.  Cannot locate a supplier for an item in a rated order or a supplier refuses 
to sell the item.
C5.2.4.  Needs authority to use a priority rating.
C5.2.5.  Needs to make sure that a supplier is treating a rated order appropriately.
C5.2.6.  Needs to resolve conflicts in the production or delivery of various rated 
orders.
C5.2.7.  Needs help placing a rated order with a supplier.
C5.2.8.  Needs to verify the urgency of a rated order.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
27
CHAPTER 5
C5.3.  REQUESTING SPECIAL PRIORITIES ASSISTANCE 
C5.3.1.  Who can request assistance? 
C5.3.1.1.  Anyone who needs SPA can ask for help, according to the DPAS.
C5.3.1.2.  In most instances, an impacted prime contractor requests SPA for:
C5.3.1.2.1.  Itself.
C5.3.1.2.2.  Its subcontractor.
C5.3.1.2.3.  Its supplier.
C5.3.1.3.  Procuring activity personnel and the cognizant CAO production 
personnel also shall remind contractors of SPA.   The affected Government program 
office can still request SPA with the prime contractor, when necessary.
C5.3.2.  When may I request assistance? 
C5.3.2.1.  Individuals may request SPA as soon as they have made every 
reasonable effort to resolve the problem.
C5.3.2.2.  They shall request SPA above the operating DPAS officer level only 
when an appropriate procuring activity official, usually the program manager, documents 
an urgent need for the item (such as grounded aircraft or a production schedule delay on 
a critical weapon system).
C5.3.2.3.  All DPAS officers shall forward any requests for SPA to higher 
headquarters if:
C5.3.2.3.1.  They cannot resolve it.
C5.3.2.3.2.  It remains a legitimate problem (i.e., urgent need but order 
was rejected).
C5.3.2.3.3.  It must go to the DUSD(IP) for action.
C5.3.3.  How do I request assistance? 
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
28
CHAPTER 5
C5.3.3.1.  Submit requests using the Form BXA-999, which DPAS officers 
shall have on hand to facilitate the process.   See 15 CFR 700.50(c) (reference (b)) for 
more information on obtaining the form.
C5.3.3.2.  Complete blocks 1 through 7 and sign the certificate in block 8 of 
Form BXA-999.   Then, send the request to the cognizant office within a DoD 
Component or an Associated Agency.   Note that:
C5.3.3.2.1.  If you're a prime contractor, submit your requests to the local 
CAO representative and/or DPAS officer, or other designated official at the DoD 
Component or Associated Agency.
C5.3.3.2.2.  Associated Agencies always shall process requests for SPA 
through the DUSD(IP).
C5.3.3.3.  Where possible, SPA information shall remain unclassified.   
Classified information shall be handled according to security procedures.
C5.4.  ASSISTANCE RENDERED BY DPAS OFFICERS 
C5.4.1.  General.   DPAS officers perform the applicable functions listed in Chapter 
2, paragraph C2.3.4.   They also shall:
C5.4.1.1.  Document thoroughly on Form BXA-999 and the attachments all 
actions at every level to process and resolve the SPA request.
C5.4.1.2.  Confirm that the required information, including urgency of rated 
program needs, on forms for assistance or sponsorship to DUSD(IP) is complete, 
accurate, and valid.
C5.4.1.3.  Forward requests through channels to the appropriate 
Service/Agency Headquarters DPAS officer who may sponsor the SPA to the 
DUSD(IP), who may forward the request to the DoC.   The request shall include an 
original and two copies of the Form BXA-999, a copy of the rated contract or purchase 
order, statement of urgency, and supporting documentation.
C5.4.2.  DPAS officers also must ensure that requests for SPA clearly demonstrate 
that:
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
29
CHAPTER 5
C5.4.2.1.  The item is necessary and urgent for national defense and the 
consequences for not providing assistance to the approved program are as stated.
C5.4.2.2.  The contractor, applicable CAOs and contract awarding activities, 
and DPAS offices from subordinate commands have made every reasonable effort to 
resolve the problem.
C5.4.2.3.  The applicant is unable to obtain, from any known qualified source, 
the required item(s) in the minimum practicable quantity or in time to meet program 
needs.
C5.4.2.4.  The production or construction schedule would be delayed if the 
applicant did not receive the item.
C5.4.2.5.  The item cannot be replaced by another item(s) that could 
effectively serve the same purpose.
C5.4.2.6.  The applicant's inventory cannot sustain the necessary production 
without receiving the item.
C5.4.2.7.  The applicant has placed, or has attempted to place, rated orders for 
the required item(s) in a timely manner.
C5.4.3.  Rejection of Requests for Assistance.   DPAS officers shall ensure that:
C5.4.3.1.  Provisions for mandatory or optional rejection of a rated order (15 
CFR 700.13(b), and (c) (reference (b)) do not apply.
C5.4.3.2.  Assistance is not prohibited (15 CFR 700.54) (reference (b)).
C5.4.3.3.  Extenuating circumstances are not present, including:
C5.4.3.3.1.  The applicant has a financial problem with its supplier, such as 
failing to pay significantly overdue invoices.
C5.4.3.3.2.  The applicant or supplier has a problem producing material 
and is trying hard to solve the problem.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

CHAPTER 5
C5.5.  CONFLICTS 
C5.5.1.  Conflicts for resources within or between the DoD Components and 
Associated Agencies shall be resolved internally or referred to the DUSD(IP) using 
Form BXA-999.
C5.5.2.  When the DoC advises the DUSD(IP) of a conflict at the contractor or 
supplier level, the DUSD(IP) shall consult the DoD Component or Associated Agency 
to verify the required delivery date and the related urgency.   Conflicts normally shall be 
resolved based on operational urgency of the end item.
C5.6.  RECORDS AND REPORTS 
15 CFR 700.91 (reference (b)) requires making and preserving, for at least 3 years, 
accurate and complete records of any transaction that DPAS covers.   The DoD 
Components and Associated Agencies shall maintain such records according to 
Component or Agency directives, as long as they comply with 15 CFR 700.91.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

CHAPTER 5
C6.  CHAPTER 6
DELIVERY AND PRODUCTION SCHEDULING
C6.1.  GENERAL 
C6.1.1.  The U.S. Government may sometimes need to divert deliveries from one 
customer to another or rearrange delivery schedules among several customers to 
support urgent approved program needs.   Likewise, the Government may have to alter a 
contractor's production schedules.
C6.1.2.  The Department of Defense has limited authority under the DPAS to 
reschedule deliveries as provided in this chapter.   The Heads of the DoD Components 
and Associated Agencies shall further delegate this authority to each Operating Element.
C6.1.3.  Rescheduling authority is limited.   A  DoD Component may reschedule 
deliveries only:
C6.1.3.1.  For contracts or orders for which the Department of Defense 
assigned priority ratings; and
C6.1.3.2.  When it determines that urgently required items cannot be delivered 
unless they are rescheduled.
C6.1.4.  An Operating Element may not reschedule deliveries if doing so would 
adversely affect another Operating Element's production schedules of rated orders.
C6.2.  RESCHEDULING DELIVERY 
C6.2.1.  Generally, the data that Operating Elements obtain from the contractor 
shall be restricted to the data on Form BXA-999.
C6.2.2.  Operating Elements shall base the decision to reschedule deliveries on all 
available information, including the effect a delivery delay may have on customers.
C6.2.3.  To reschedule deliveries, the Procuring Activity issues a letter of 
understanding followed by a contract modification from the cognizant PCO, as well as a 
DoC Directive, when the DUSD(IP) recommends doing so.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
32
CHAPTER 6
C6.3.  RESCHEDULING PRODUCTION 
C6.3.1.  General 
C6.3.1.1.  Although rescheduling delivery of finished items may relieve 
temporary shortages, contractors must resolve, at the production level, serious problems 
affecting their delivery before the items are produced.
C6.3.1.2.  The DUSD(IP) may direct a DoD Component to negotiate with a 
contractor to reschedule the production of items that are essential to DoD-approved 
programs.
C6.3.2.  Limitations.   Changes may be negotiated only with a consenting contractor, 
and not industry-wide, to reschedule production of selected items within the 
contractor's facility, according to this section.   However, the negotiating DoD 
Component may not reschedule production if doing so will displace or delay the 
delivery of any items other than those identified in contracts issued by or on its behalf.
C6.3.3.  How do I Reschedule Production? 
C6.3.3.1.  Obtain as much information as possible from the contractor on the 
impact of the proposed production rescheduling on other rated orders.
C6.3.3.2.  Request SPA if:
C6.3.3.2.1.  Rescheduling production would impact the production and 
delivery of items in any rated order issued by any other Operating Element.
C6.3.3.2.2.  Affected customers do not agree to the changes.   (See 
Chapter 5.)
C6.3.3.3.  The cognizant PCO (or ACO with the PCO's approval) shall 
reschedule production by issuing a contract modification.

INTERNATIONAL
C7.1.  GENERAL 
C7.1.1.  Projects or programs of foreign countries and coproduction programs 
between the United States and foreign countries that support U.S. national defense 
interests may receive the same priority access to U.S. industrial resources as U.S. 
military projects and programs.   The DUSD(IP) shall sponsor all requests for priority 
authority or special priorities assistance before the DoC may act on them.
C7.1.2.  DPAS procedures for U.S. military offshore construction are in Chapter 4.
C7.1.3.  The DPA and the DPAS apply only to transactions in any State, 
Commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States, and the District of 
Columbia.
C7.2.  UNITED STATES -- CANADA 
C7.2.1.  Priority Rating Authority Between the United States and Canada 
C7.2.1.1.  15 CFR 700.55(b) (reference (b)) contains provisions for obtaining 
priorities assistance with Canadian suppliers.   The DoC coordinates with the Canadian 
Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) on all matters 
of mutual concern relating to the DPAS.
C7.2.1.2.  The DoD Components and Associated Agencies may not place rated 
orders with Canadian contractors or suppliers for items to support DoD-approved 
programs.   However, they shall inform the Canadian supplier that the items are for U.S. 
defense purposes.   They shall also inform the Canadian supplier to contact the PWGSC 
for authority to place rated orders in the United States if the Canadian supplier needs 
production or construction items to fill the orders from U.S. vendors.
C7.2.1.3.  The DoC authorizes the PWGSC to use priority ratings in the United 
States to support the following approved programs:
C7.2.1.3.1.  D1 -- Canadian military programs.
C7.2.1.3.2.  D2 -- Canadian production and construction.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

CHAPTER 7
C7.2.1.3.3.  D3 -- Canadian atomic energy program.
C7.2.1.4.  The PWGSC may authorize a DO or DX rating for procurements in 
the United States that support rated U.S. programs.
C7.2.1.5.  PCOs issuing contracts for acquisitions in Canada shall be familiar 
with the PWGSC.
C7.2.2.  Special Priorities Assistance 
C7.2.2.1.  The DoC provides SPA as needed to Canadian procurements in the 
United States for Canadian programs.
C7.2.2.2.  The PWGSC assists U.S. procurements in Canada that support 
U.S.-approved programs.   The DoC must sponsor requests for such assistance.emsp; 
DUSD(IP) submits Form BXA-999 to the DoC, which then forwards it to the PWGSC.
C7.2.3.  Compliance.   The PWGSC ensures that Canadian Government personnel 
and contractors comply with the DPAS when placing rated orders in the United States.
C7.2.4.  Conflicts.   The DPAS provisions on the precedence of rated orders apply 
equally to Canadian-approved and DoD-issued rated orders.   When the DPAS rules 
cannot do so, the DUSD(IP) shall resolve conflicts between these two types of orders.
C7.3.  PROCEDURES FOR FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO RECEIVE PRIORITY RATINGS 
C7.3.1.  In appropriate cases, the USD(AT&L) may recommend that the DoC 
authorize the use of priority ratings to support the direct defense needs of foreign 
countries other than Canada for industrial resources from the United States.
C7.3.2.  Requests for foreign country use of priority ratings must be sponsored by 
the government of the foreign nation.
C7.3.3.  How to Submit Requests For Priority Ratings 
C7.3.3.1.  Military Programs the United States Finances.   A foreign 
government or contractor, who must procure items in the United States to support 
U.S.-financed military programs, including contracts that DoD Operating Elements 
place, first shall endeavor to obtain the items through unrated orders with U.S. suppliers.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
35
CHAPTER 7
C7.3.3.1.1.  If the foreign government or contractor cannot receive the 
item on time without a priority rating, they may request authority by letter through the 
appropriate military channels.   This letter shall detail the circumstances and include:
C7.3.3.1.1.1.  The specific information necessary for Form BXA-999.
C7.3.3.1.1.2.  A list of U.S. suppliers.
C7.3.3.1.1.3.  A statement that the items cannot be produced or 
procured from foreign sources in time to meet the approved production or deployment 
schedule.
C7.3.3.1.2.  If it considers the request valid and other means cannot 
satisfy the need, the DoD Operating Element shall execute a Form BXA-999 and 
forward it to the DUSD(IP) for sponsorship to the DoC.
C7.3.3.2.  Other Foreign Military Programs.   To request priority rating 
authority for direct defense needs other than U.S. financed military programs:
C7.3.3.2.1.  A foreign government or contractor, through its government 
(Ministry of Defense), shall address a letter, with the information cited in subparagraph 
C7.3.3.1.1., above, to the DUSD(IP) through the country's Washington, DC, military 
office.
C7.3.3.2.2.  The country's defense representative or the overseas 
command concerned shall review the request, prepare a BXA-999, and forward the letter 
and the BXA-999 to the DUSD(IP) for sponsorship to the DoC.
C7.3.4.  How to Request Special Priorities Assistance.   After placing a rated order 
with a U.S. supplier, if a foreign government or contractor needs SPA to ensure that they 
receive their delivery on time, or for any other reason under the DPAS, then:
C7.3.4.1.  The country's defense representative, the overseas command, or the 
DoD Operating Element shall prepare a Form BXA-999.
C7.3.4.2.  The DoD Operating Element shall forward requests it cannot resolve 
to the DUSD(IP), who shall forward it to the DoC for sponsorship.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

CHAPTER 7
C7.4.  OVERSEAS CONTRACTORS SUPPORTING DoD PROGRAMS 
C7.4.1.  Overseas contractors supporting approved DoD programs shall receive 
equal priority rating authority and SPA to U.S. contractors.   However, overseas 
contractors supporting approved DoD programs may not automatically place rated 
orders with U.S. manufacturers.
C7.4.2.  Overseas contractors who require items from U.S. suppliers shall make 
every effort to obtain them without help from the U.S. Government.   When contractors 
cannot locate a supplier or obtain timely delivery, they shall submit a letter to the DoD 
contract office administering the prime contract.   The request for assistance shall 
contain necessary information via a Form BXA-999.
C7.4.3.  The DoD Component whose jurisdiction the contract is under shall 
designate a representative who is responsible for:
C7.4.3.1.  Determining whether:
C7.4.3.1.1.  The overseas contractor needs and orders quantities of 
material from the United States that are consistent with the contract and schedule.
C7.4.3.1.2.  Priority rating authority or other SPA is necessary.
C7.4.3.2.  Preparing and submitting a Form BXA-999 through the sponsoring 
DPAS Officer to the DUSD(IP).
C7.4.3.3.  Initiating additional Form BXA-999s if the overseas supplier needs 
further assistance obtaining required materials.
C7.5.  COMPLIANCE REVIEWS 
C7.5.1.  In situations as described in section C7.4., above, overseas contractors 
supporting DoD programs may receive the authority to use the DPAS rating.   The 
authorizing DoD Component has cognizant responsibility and, therefore, shall review the 
contractor's appropriate records and purchase orders to ensure that they comply with the 
DPAS.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002
37
CHAPTER 7
C7.5.2.  The Defense Contract Management Agency International is responsible for 
conducting DPAS compliance reviews to ensure that overseas contractors use material, 
components, or parts they acquire from U.S. contractors under the DPAS for the 
authorized purpose.   The cognizant DoD Component may participate, or appoint an 
appropriate designee to participate, in these reviews.
C7.6.  COPRODUCTION PROGRAMS 
C7.6.1.  General.   Programs involving components for military systems that the 
United States and foreign countries both manufacture and deploy are coproduction

C8.1.3.  The DUSD(IP) may revise DoD contract priorities during crises or 
emergency situations to reflect the needs of the immediate situation.
C8.2.  POLICY 
C8.2.1.  Urgency.   The Secretary of Defense approves DX ratings for DoD 
programs that are of the highest national defense urgency based on military objectives.
C8.2.2.  Coverage and Use 
C8.2.2.1.  All DX-rated programs have equal priority with each other and take 
precedence over DO-rated orders and unrated orders (which also are called commercial 
orders).
C8.2.2.2.  DX-rated programs and projects remain DX-rated programs until the 
USD(AT&L) withdraws them.   Programs shall retain the DX rating as long as special 
attention is necessary to reach and maintain the established production rates or 
quantities.   When the USD(AT&L) requires, DoD Operating Elements shall submit 
updated production and acquisition data for DX-rated programs.   DoD Operating

C8.3.  PROCEDURES 
C8.3.1.  DX-Rating Program Nominations 
C8.3.1.1.  The Heads of the DoD Components and the Associated Agencies 
shall submit DX program nominations, as necessary, to the DUSD(IP).   Section C8.4. 
and Appendix 1 provide a description and an example of the required information and 
format.
C8.3.1.2.  To qualify for a DX-rating nomination, a program must satisfy the 
following conditions:
C8.3.1.2.1.  It must be of the highest national defense urgency.
C8.3.1.2.2.  The Procuring Activity must compress program schedules 
substantially to meet assigned milestones that are essential to national defense 
objectives.
C8.3.1.2.3.  A DX rating will alleviate identified production resources 
difficulties.
C8.3.1.2.4.  A DO rating has been or will be detrimental to program 
schedule requirements and national defense objectives.
C8.3.1.3.  After coordinating with responsible OSD offices (program

the decision.
C8.3.1.5.  The sponsoring DPAS Officer shall continuously monitor DX-rated 
programs.   When a DoD Operating Element recommends that the USD(AT&L) 
redesignate DX-rated programs to DO-rated programs, it shall forward the 
recommendation to the DUSD(IP).
C8.3.2.  Procedures During Crises or Emergency Situations 
C8.3.2.1.  If a crisis or emergency situation occurs, the DUSD(IP) may review 
priorities for all DoD contracts (whether DX- or DO-rated) to determine if he or she 
must realign priorities to provide more responsive guidance for industrial base support.
C8.3.2.2.  The DUSD(IP), working with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff and appropriate personnel from the DoD Components, is responsible for revising 
contract priorities based on emerging crisis or emergency requirements.

EXAMPLE, JUSTIFICATION
FOR
DX-RATING NOMINATIONS
AP1.1.  MILITARY JUSTIFICATION 
Provide a Statement of Military Justification.   Include a brief narrative statement 
explaining what the item is, how the item is to be used, the item's importance to the 
military, and the system and/or items it is replacing, for example:
AP1.1.1.  Military Justification                          "X" Aircraft
AP1.1.2.  The "X" aircraft is a supersonic, two-engine, two-seat, all-weather 
carrier-based fighter aircraft designed to operate from the __________ and the 
_______ class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.   The "X" aircraft is equipped for 
in-flight refueling and fuel jettisoning.   This aircraft is the only currently programmed 
high-performance aircraft that is effective against the air breathing air threat at remote 
ranges (outside of the missile-release lines).   Without this aircraft, the Navy's Fleet Air 
Defense will be below the acceptable limit.   Operational requirement number 
AD-100000-Z of December 31, 1990, priority 1A, applies.   The "X" aircraft is the most 
effective carrier-based fighter aircraft weapon system capable of intercepting and 
destroying multiple enemy attack aircraft in all conditions of weather and visibility at 
high and low altitudes.
AP1.2.  INDUSTRIAL RESOURCE JUSTIFICATION 
  Provide a Statement of Production Resource Justification that includes:
AP1.2.1.  Estimated cost, for example:
  
This Program is estimated to cost1 approximately $ _________ million ($ __________ 
million for facilities construction) for X number aircraft.   Of the total cost, 
approximately $ ________ million is estimated to be for critical components and 
materials needing special attention and expediting to meet the established schedule.
   
__________
 1 Total value of items, not to exceed $ ______ million.
DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

APPENDIX 1
AP1.2.2.  Identify critical components (and their suppliers) that are anticipated to 
need special attention to support the program schedule and/or surge production rates in 
a crisis, for example:
AP1.2.2.1.  Special test equipment from Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA.
AP1.2.2.1.1.  Recording oscillographs.
AP1.2.2.1.2.  Galvanometers.
AP1.2.2.1.3.  Linear and angular accelerometers.
AP1.2.2.2.  Electronic components:
AP1.2.2.2.1.  Tubes from Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX.
AP1.2.2.2.2.  Transistors from National Semiconductor, San Jose, CA.
AP1.2.2.3.  Special hydraulic pumps, motors, and valves from Cleveland 
Pneumatics, Cleveland, OH.
AP1.2.3.  Identify anticipated critical and/or strategic material shortages2 for either 
the end item or components involved, which include:
AP1.2.3.1.  Small mill-runs for nonstandard, heat-resisting, high-temperature 
steels, and other alloys (extrusions, sheets, and forgings) for wings.
AP1.2.3.2.  Monel "K" metal for wing parts (200 pounds, including scrap, 
required to produce one aircraft).
AP1.2.3.3.  Cobalt for tail section (487 pounds, including scrap, required to 
produce one aircraft).
AP1.2.4.  Identify anticipated shortages of special production equipment that 
require priority assistance, such as a Five Axis grinder, Cincinnati Milicron, Columbus, 
OH.

APPENDIX 1
AP1.2.5.  Describe actions being taken or needed to meet program schedules, for 
example,
  
The Department of the Navy is taking all necessary actions to expedite these items to 
meet the target date.   Thirty percent of required contracts and purchase orders have 
been issued.   Six special priorities assistance requests (BXA Form 999) were processed 
through December 31, 1990; four for critical components ($20,000) and two for 
materials ($10,000).   Provide details of these cases.   Since the normal schedule of 6 
years will be compressed into approximately 4 years, this program should be in the DX 
priority rating category to ensure expeditious handling of future difficulties, as outlined 
above, at the expense of all DO-rated and unrated items when conflicts occur.
AP1.2.6.  Identify major single (S) and sole-source (SS) producers and locations, 
for example:
AP1.2.6.1.  TFXX Engines, GE, Evandale, OH (S).
AP1.2.6.2.  Landing Gear, Cleveland Pneumatic, Akron, OH (SS).
AP1.2.7.  Identify contractor's ability to surge production (if required) and the 
minimum time needed to complete deliveries under peacetime (assume no waivers for 
laws, regulations, etc.), for example:
AP1.2.7.1.  End Item:  Minimum surge potential; decreasing from 32 to 16 
months for aircraft.
AP1.2.7.2.  Major components:  Engines; good surge potential; decreasing 
from 24 to 10 months with rolling inventory.
