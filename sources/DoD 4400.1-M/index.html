C1. CHAPTER 1
GENERAL INFORMATION
C1.1. REISSUANCE AND PURPOSE. Under the authority of DoD Directive 4400.1 (reference (a)), this Manual updates the 
operating guidelines that the DoD Components and Associated Agencies use to 
implement the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) (15 CFR 700) 
(reference (b)). C1.2. POLICY 
Classification. The Department of Defense's list of DX-rated programs is unclassified. C1.3. APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE 
C1.3.1. Authority to require priority performance of contracts and orders under 
the Defense Production Act (DPA) (reference (c)) and the statutes listed at reference 
(d), for industrial services, has been delegated to the Department of Commerce (DoC).</div><div id="chunk-11" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> To implement this authority, the DoC is responsible for developing, coordinating, 
administering, and enforcing the DPAS regulation (reference (b)). The DoC has 
authorized the Department of Defense to apply priority ratings to contracts and orders 
that support the DoD-approved national defense program categories in DPAS Schedule 
1. C1.3.2. This Manual:
C1.3.2.1. Implements the DPAS for the Department of Defense. It is not a 
guide for industry. Users also shall become familiar with reference (b). C1.3.2.2. References DD Form 691, "DoD Application for Priority rating for 
Production or Construction Equipment," and DoC Form BXA-999, "Request for Special 
Priorities Assistance." Electronic versions of these forms are preferable.</div><div id="chunk-12" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> The DoD

ABBREVIATIONS AND/OR ACRONYMS
C1.4. AUTHORITIES AND LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND 
C1.4.1. Congress enacted the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. 2061, et seq.) (reference (c)) to help ensure, among other measures, that products, 
materials, and services needed for defense are expeditiously available. Title I of the 
Act, entitled "Priorities and Allocations," authorizes the President to:
C1.4.1.1. Require that certain defense and energy contracts and orders be 
performed on a priority basis. C1.4.1.2.</div><div id="chunk-13" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Allocate materials, services, and facilities to promote the national 
defense. C1.4.2. Although Congress has revised the DPA many times, the basic intent of 
Title I and its implementing regulations remains the same, namely to help keep current 
defense and energy programs on schedule and to provide a framework for rapid 
industrial response in a national emergency. C1.4.3. Should the authority of the DPA expire, Section 18 of the Selective 
Service Act (SSA) (50 U.S.C. App. 468) (reference (d)) and other authorities listed in 
Executive Order 12742 (reference (e)) authorize the Government to obtain articles or 
materials from contractors promptly and exclusively for the U.S. Armed Forces. DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

C2.1. AUTHORITIES 
C2.1.1.</div><div id="chunk-14" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Title I of the DPA authorizes the President to:
C2.1.1.1. Require that contractors accept and execute contracts or orders 
relating to certain approved defense or energy programs on a priority basis over all 
other contracts and orders. C2.1.1.2. Allocate materials, services, and facilities to promote approved 
programs for the national defense. C2.1.2. Section 18 of the SSA (reference (d)) authorizes the Government to obtain 
priority delivery of articles or materials exclusively for the Armed Forces of the United 
States. This applies to any person operating a plant, mine, or other facility that can 
produce similar quantities of these materials. C2.1.3. There are other authorities listed in Executive Order 12742 (reference (e)) 
that provide priority for contracts and orders of the Armed Forces. C2.2.</div><div id="chunk-15" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY 
C2.2.1. To carry out priority authorities, the President, by Executive Orders 
(references (e) and (f)) has delegated Priorities and Allocations (P&A) authority for 
industrial resources (articles, materials, including construction materials, services, and 
facilities) to the Secretary of Commerce to support approved national defense 
programs. C2.2.2. The DoC implements its P&A authority by issuing, administering, and 
enforcing the DPAS Regulation 15 CFR 700 (reference (b)). The Secretary of 
Commerce has redelegated authority under the DPAS to the Secretary of Defense to 
rate contracts and orders that support national defense programs the Department of 
Defense approves. (See DPAS Delegation 1 in reference (b).) DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

C4.5.1. The Department of Defense may only use P&A authority for construction 
in Government-financed programs such as the "C2-approved" program. However, some 
construction projects that are normally not eligible for a priority rating may be 
important enough to receive one. The DoC authorizes priority ratings for private 
industrial expansion and may assign the DX or DO rating symbol to construction 
projects. C4.5.2. The DoD Components and Associated Agencies may use Form BXA-999 
(see Chapter 5) to sponsor applications for privately financed industrial expansion

SPECIAL PRIORITIES ASSISTANCE
C5.1  GENERAL 
When defense prime contracts are properly rated, and the priority ratings are properly 
extended (15 CFR 700.15) (reference (b)) to the lowest level subcontractor and vendor, 
the preferential scheduling provisions of DPAS (15 CFR 700.14) (reference (b)) 
generally are self-executing. Occasionally, however, Government buying activities, 
prime contractors, subcontractors, and other suppliers may need assistance in obtaining 
timely deliveries or authority to use priority ratings on orders for items not normally 
ratable.</div><div id="chunk-47" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> 15 CFR 700.50 through 700.55 (reference (b)) outlines the basic SPA 
provisions. C5.2. TYPES OF ASSISTANCE 
While persons can request SPA for any reason to support the DPAS, they usually 
receive SPA when they:
C5.2.1. Are having difficulty obtaining a rated order by the required delivery date at 
any level of the supply chain such as prime contractor, subcontractor, or vendor. C5.2.2. Want to accelerate the delivery of a rated order due to a change in the 
military urgency and the supplier cannot comply because of other rated orders. C5.2.3. Cannot locate a supplier for an item in a rated order or a supplier refuses 
to sell the item. C5.2.4. Needs authority to use a priority rating.</div><div id="chunk-48" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> C5.2.5. Needs to make sure that a supplier is treating a rated order appropriately. C5.2.6. Needs to resolve conflicts in the production or delivery of various rated 
orders. C5.2.7. Needs help placing a rated order with a supplier. C5.2.8. Needs to verify the urgency of a rated order. DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

C5.3.1. Who can request assistance?</div><div id="chunk-49" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> C5.3.1.1. Anyone who needs SPA can ask for help, according to the DPAS. C5.3.1.2. In most instances, an impacted prime contractor requests SPA for:
C5.3.1.2.1. Itself. C5.3.1.2.2. Its subcontractor. C5.3.1.2.3. Its supplier. C5.3.1.3.</div><div id="chunk-50" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Procuring activity personnel and the cognizant CAO production 
personnel also shall remind contractors of SPA. The affected Government program 
office can still request SPA with the prime contractor, when necessary. C5.3.2. When may I request assistance? C5.3.2.1. Individuals may request SPA as soon as they have made every 
reasonable effort to resolve the problem. C5.3.2.2. They shall request SPA above the operating DPAS officer level only 
when an appropriate procuring activity official, usually the program manager, documents 
an urgent need for the item (such as grounded aircraft or a production schedule delay on 
a critical weapon system). C5.3.2.3. All DPAS officers shall forward any requests for SPA to higher 
headquarters if:
C5.3.2.3.1.</div><div id="chunk-51" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> They cannot resolve it. C5.3.2.3.2. It remains a legitimate problem (i.e., urgent need but order

DELIVERY AND PRODUCTION SCHEDULING
C6.1. GENERAL 
C6.1.1. The U.S. Government may sometimes need to divert deliveries from one 
customer to another or rearrange delivery schedules among several customers to 
support urgent approved program needs.</div><div id="chunk-58" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> Likewise, the Government may have to alter a 
contractor's production schedules. C6.1.2. The Department of Defense has limited authority under the DPAS to 
reschedule deliveries as provided in this chapter. The Heads of the DoD Components 
and Associated Agencies shall further delegate this authority to each Operating Element. C6.1.3. Rescheduling authority is limited. A  DoD Component may reschedule 
deliveries only:
C6.1.3.1. For contracts or orders for which the Department of Defense 
assigned priority ratings; and
C6.1.3.2. When it determines that urgently required items cannot be delivered 
unless they are rescheduled. C6.1.4.</div><div id="chunk-59" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> An Operating Element may not reschedule deliveries if doing so would

C6.2.1. Generally, the data that Operating Elements obtain from the contractor 
shall be restricted to the data on Form BXA-999. C6.2.2. Operating Elements shall base the decision to reschedule deliveries on all 
available information, including the effect a delivery delay may have on customers. C6.2.3. To reschedule deliveries, the Procuring Activity issues a letter of 
understanding followed by a contract modification from the cognizant PCO, as well as a 
DoC Directive, when the DUSD(IP) recommends doing so. DoD 4400.1-M, Feb. 21, 2002

C6.3.1.</div><div id="chunk-60" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> General 
C6.3.1.1. Although rescheduling delivery of finished items may relieve 
temporary shortages, contractors must resolve, at the production level, serious problems 
affecting their delivery before the items are produced. C6.3.1.2. The DUSD(IP) may direct a DoD Component to negotiate with a 
contractor to reschedule the production of items that are essential to DoD-approved 
programs. C6.3.2. Limitations. Changes may be negotiated only with a consenting contractor, 
and not industry-wide, to reschedule production of selected items within the 
contractor's facility, according to this section. However, the negotiating DoD 
Component may not reschedule production if doing so will displace or delay the 
delivery of any items other than those identified in contracts issued by or on its behalf. C6.3.3. How do I Reschedule Production?</div><div id="chunk-61" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> C6.3.3.1. Obtain as much information as possible from the contractor on the

carrier-based fighter aircraft designed to operate from the __________ and the 
_______ class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The "X" aircraft is equipped for 
in-flight refueling and fuel jettisoning. This aircraft is the only currently programmed 
high-performance aircraft that is effective against the air breathing air threat at remote 
ranges (outside of the missile-release lines). Without this aircraft, the Navy's Fleet Air 
Defense will be below the acceptable limit. Operational requirement number 
AD-100000-Z of December 31, 1990, priority 1A, applies. The "X" aircraft is the most
