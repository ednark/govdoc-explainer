To ensure compliance with the government standards outlined in the E-Government Act of 2002 and corresponding measures, you should integrate the following list of actions into your web application project:

1. **Privacy and Security Plan**: Develop a detailed plan outlining how the application will protect personal data, support confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Include measures for encryption, secure data storage, and secure data transmission.

2. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure the web application conforms to Section 508 standards to make it accessible to users with disabilities. Implement features like screen reader compatibility, keyboard-only navigation, and adherence to WCAG guidelines.

3. **Information Security**: Incorporate a robust information security framework, including regular risk assessments and audits. Utilize intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and continuous monitoring of security controls.

4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Design and implement strict access controls ensuring that users have access only to the information and functionalities necessary for their roles.

5. **Data Integrity Measures**: Deploy mechanisms to ensure data integrity, including input validation to prevent data manipulation and errors.

6. **Incident Response Plan**: Establish a formal incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to data breaches or security incidents.

7. **User Data Privacy**: Follow best practices for user data handling as prescribed under the E-Government Act's privacy provisions. This should include clear user consent forms, privacy policies, and secure mechanisms for user data storage and retrieval.

8. **Audit and Compliance Reporting**: Implement logging and auditing capabilities to track access and changes to sensitive data and configurations. Regular compliance reports should be prepared and reviewed by designated officials.

9. **Interoperability and Data Sharing**: Design the application with interoperability in mind, using standard data formats and protocols as recommended by the E-Government Act to facilitate data sharing among different government systems.

10. **Secure Development Practices**: Adopt secure coding practices during the development of the application, conduct security testing including vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

11. **Public Disclosure and Transparency**: Ensure transparency in operations by providing details about data collection, usage, and sharing practices publicly as appropriate, without compromising security or privacy.

12. **Continuity of Operations**: Develop a plan to maintain essential functions and services in the event of various contingencies, such as technical failures, cyber-attacks, or natural disasters.

Each of these actions involves coordinated efforts across technical and management teams to ensure compliance and secure, effective service delivery to all users.
