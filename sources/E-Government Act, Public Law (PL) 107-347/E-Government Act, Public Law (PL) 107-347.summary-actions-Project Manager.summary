As a project manager for a web application development company working on government-related projects, ensuring compliance with the Government Standards Document (116 STAT. 2899, E-Government Act of 2002) involves a set of specific actions. Below is a minimal list that summarizes the essential steps you must undertake:

1. **Enhance Security Measures**: Implement robust security protocols to protect information and services, especially focusing on the access, use, disclosure, and integrity of the data handled by the web application.

2. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure the web application is accessible to individuals with disabilities, adhering to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

3. **Privacy Protection**: Incorporate privacy protections into the application according to Subtitle II—Federal Management and Promotion of Electronic Government Services, ensuring personal data is collected, used, and shared in compliance with federal privacy guidelines.

4. **Maintain Data Confidentiality**: Implement and enforce policies to protect confidential information consistent with the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act provisions in the legislation.

5. **Support Interoperability**: Develop or integrate technology that promotes interoperability with other government systems, facilitating seamless interaction and data exchange.

6. **Engage in Regular Assessments**: Regularly test and evaluate the security and accessibility measures of the application to ensure ongoing compliance and to address vulnerabilities promptly.

7. **Provide Training**: Conduct regular training sessions for all team members on compliance with government standards, including security protocols, privacy policies, and accessibility guidelines.

8. **Implement Performance Measures**: Establish performance metrics to assess the application’s effectiveness in achieving intended functionalities securely and accessibly, as outlined in TITLE III—Information Security of the act.

9. **Documentation and Reporting**: Maintain thorough documentation of compliance efforts and security breaches, if any; provide mandatory reports as required by the governing standards to relevant government bodies. 

10. **Audit and Continuous Improvement**: Conduct periodic audits of the application’s compliance with all applicable federal regulations and standards, and use audit results to drive continuous improvement in security and functionality.

Each of these actions involves multiple steps and coordination across different teams, but focusing on these areas will help ensure that your web application complies with the necessary government standards and regulations.
