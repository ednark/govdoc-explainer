Certainly! Here's a minimal list of actions from a developer specialized in implementing Drupal, focusing on backend business logic for ensuring compliance with government standards:

1. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms.

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data and functionality based on user roles.

3. **Secure Authentication**
   - Integrate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user logins.
   - Use secure protocols for authentication processes.

4. **Input Validation**
   - Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
 
5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement logging mechanisms to record access and modifications to critical data.
   - Ensure logs are monitored for suspicious activities.

6. **API Security**
   - Use secure methods for API endpoints, ensuring proper authentication and authorization.
   - Enable rate limiting to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

7. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Implement regular data backups and test recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and availability.

8. **Compliance with Accessibility Standards**
   - Ensure the application adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.

9. **Privacy Considerations**
   - Implement privacy policies and procedures to comply with data protection regulations.
   - Ensure compliance with section 208 of the E-Government Act for privacy provisions.

10. **Regular Security Patching**
    - Regularly update Drupal core and contributed modules to apply security patches.

11. **Segregation of Duties**
    - Ensure separation of development, testing, and production environments.

12. **Content Management**
    - Use Drupalâ€™s content moderation workflows for approving and publishing content.

These actions provide a foundational approach for securing a web application while meeting relevant compliance requirements.
