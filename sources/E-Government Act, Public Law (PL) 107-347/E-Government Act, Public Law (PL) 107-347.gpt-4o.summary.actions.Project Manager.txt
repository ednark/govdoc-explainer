Sure, here is a minimal list of actions a project manager must track for a web application project to ensure compliance with the E-Government Act of 2002 standards:

1. **Designate Compliance Leader**:
   Assign a senior team member as the information security compliance officer for the project.

2. **Assess Risks**:
   Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential areas of vulnerability in terms of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, and data integrity.

3. **Protection Measures**:
   Implement and document information security protections commensurate with the identified risk levels.

4. **Develop Policies and Procedures**:
   Develop and enforce policies and procedures ensuring compliance with standards, including those issued under section 11331 of title 40.

5. **Train Personnel**:
   Ensure all team members, contractors, and relevant partners receive training on the projectâ€™s information security policies, procedures, and their role in compliance.

6. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   Set up a process for continuous monitoring, periodic testing, and evaluation of information security controls and techniques.

7. **Data Collection Methods**:
   Ensure data collection methodologies and interfaces are compatible with formats and systems required by the standards and guidelines.
