(1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly trans-
forming societal interactions and the relationships among citi-
zens, private businesses, and the Government. (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in
applying advances in information technology to enhance govern-
mental functions and services, achieve more efficient perform-
ance, increase access to Government information, and increase
citizen participation in Government. (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government
are developed and presented separately, according to the juris-
dictional boundaries of an individual department or agency,
rather than being integrated cooperatively according to function
or topic. (4) Internet-based Government services involving inter-
agency cooperation are especially difficult to develop and pro-
mote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding mechanisms
to support such interagency cooperation. (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved
Government performance and outcomes within and across agen-
cies. (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the
management of Government, to be implemented as part of
a management framework that also addresses finance, procure-
ment, human capital, and other challenges to improve the
performance of Government.</div><div id="chunk-14" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government
performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-
based technology requires strong leadership, better organiza-
tion, improved interagency collaboration, and more focused
oversight of agency compliance with statutes related to informa-
tion resource management. (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are the following:
(1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government
efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services
and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new Office
of Electronic Government within the Office of Management
and Budget. 44 USC 3601

(2) To promote use of the Internet and other information
technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen
participation in Government. (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing elec-
tronic Government services, where this collaboration would
improve the service to citizens by integrating related functions,
and in the use of internal electronic Government processes,
where this collaboration would improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of the processes. (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve
agency missions and program performance goals. (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging tech-
nologies within and across Government agencies to provide
citizen-centric Government information and services. (6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other
Government entities.</div><div id="chunk-15" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> (7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy
makers. (8) To promote access to high quality Government informa-

and accountable. (10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where
appropriate, best practices from public and private sector
organizations. (11) To provide enhanced access to Government information
and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding protec-
tion of personal privacy, national security, records retention,
access for persons with disabilities, and other relevant laws. TITLE I—OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND

savings contract shall be awarded for a period of not more than
five years. ‘‘(B) A share-in-savings contract may be awarded for a period
greater than five years, but not more than 10 years, if the head
of the agency determines in writing prior to award of the contract
that—
‘‘(i) the level of risk to be assumed and the investment
to be undertaken by the contractor is likely to inhibit the
government from obtaining the needed information technology
competitively at a fair and reasonable price if the contract
is limited in duration to a period of five years or less; and
‘‘(ii) usage of the information technology to be acquired
is likely to continue for a period of time sufficient to generate
reasonable benefit for the government. ‘‘(3) Contracts awarded pursuant to the authority of this section
shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be performance-based
contracts that identify objective outcomes and contain performance
standards that will be used to measure achievement and milestones
that must be met before payment is made. ‘‘(4) Contracts awarded pursuant to the authority of this section
shall include a provision containing a quantifiable baseline that
is to be the basis upon which a savings share ratio is established
that governs the amount of payment a contractor is to receive
under the contract. Before commencement of performance of such
a contract, the senior procurement executive of the agency shall
determine in writing that the terms of the provision are quantifiable
and will likely yield value to the Government. ‘‘(5)(A) The head of the agency may retain savings realized
through the use of a share-in-savings contract under this section
that are in excess of the total amount of savings paid to the
contractor under the contract, but may not retain any portion

STATUTES
REGARDING
FALSE
STATEMENTS.—Notwith-
standing section 512, information collected by an agency for exclu-
sively statistical purposes under a pledge of confidentiality may
be provided by the collecting agency to a law enforcement agency
for the prosecution of submissions to the collecting agency of false
statistical information under statutes that authorize criminal pen-
alties (such as section 221 of title 13, United States Code) or
civil penalties for the provision of false statistical information,
unless such disclosure or use would otherwise be prohibited under
Federal law. (h) CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this title shall be construed
as restricting or diminishing any confidentiality protections or pen-
alties for unauthorized disclosure that otherwise apply to data
or information collected for statistical purposes or nonstatistical
purposes, including, but not limited to, section 6103 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6103).</div><div id="chunk-103" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> (i) AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS.—Nothing in this title shall be

Protection
SEC. 511. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:
(1) Individuals, businesses, and other organizations have
varying degrees of legal protection when providing information
to the agencies for strictly statistical purposes. (2) Pledges of confidentiality by agencies provide assur-
ances to the public that information about individuals or
organizations or provided by individuals or organizations for
exclusively statistical purposes will be held in confidence and
will not be used against such individuals or organizations in
any agency action. (3) Protecting the confidentiality interests of individuals
or organizations who provide information under a pledge of
confidentiality for Federal statistical programs serves both the
interests of the public and the needs of society. (4) Declining trust of the public in the protection of informa-
tion provided under a pledge of confidentiality to the agencies
adversely affects both the accuracy and completeness of statis-
tical analyses. (5) Ensuring that information provided under a pledge
of confidentiality for statistical purposes receives protection
is essential in continuing public cooperation in statistical pro-
grams. (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this subtitle are the following:
(1) To ensure that information supplied by individuals or
organizations to an agency for statistical purposes under a
pledge of confidentiality is used exclusively for statistical pur-
poses. (2) To ensure that individuals or organizations who supply
information under a pledge of confidentiality to agencies for
statistical purposes will neither have that information disclosed

TICAL PURPOSES.—A statistical agency or unit shall clearly distin-
guish any data or information it collects for nonstatistical purposes
(as authorized by law) and provide notice to the public, before
the data or information is collected, that the data or information
could be used for nonstatistical purposes. (d) DESIGNATION OF AGENTS.—A statistical agency or unit may
designate agents, by contract or by entering into a special agreement
containing the provisions required under section 502(2) for treat-
ment as an agent under that section, who may perform exclusively
statistical activities, subject to the limitations and penalties
described in this title. SEC. 513. FINES AND PENALTIES. Whoever, being an officer, employee, or agent of an agency
acquiring information for exclusively statistical purposes, having
taken and subscribed the oath of office, or having sworn to observe
the limitations imposed by section 512, comes into possession of
such information by reason of his or her being an officer, employee,

Subtitle B—Statistical Efficiency
SEC. 521. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:
(1) Federal statistics are an important source of information
for public and private decision-makers such as policymakers,
consumers, businesses, investors, and workers. (2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek
to improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the
ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve
higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs. (3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the willing-
ness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys. Reducing
reporting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore
lead to more accurate characterizations of the economy. (4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau
of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the
Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes
will improve their ability to track more accurately the large
and rapidly changing nature of United States business.</div><div id="chunk-107" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> In
particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better ensure
that businesses are consistently classified in appropriate indus-
tries, resolve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that
are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new
businesses in a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting
errors quickly and efficiently. (5) The Congress enacted the International Investment and
Trade in Services Act of 1990 that allowed the Bureau of
the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau
of Labor Statistics to share data on foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed industry coverage from
135 industries to over 800 industries with no increase in the
data collected from respondents but also demonstrated how
data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data prod-
ucts. (6) With subtitle A of this title, the sharing of business
data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic
Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to ensure
the highest level of confidentiality for respondents to statistical
surveys. (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this subtitle are the following:
(1) To authorize the sharing of business data among the
Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and
the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical pur-
poses. (2) To reduce the paperwork burdens imposed on businesses
that provide requested information to the Federal Government. (3) To improve the comparability and accuracy of Federal
economic statistics by allowing the Bureau of the Census, the
Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics to update sample frames, develop consistent classifications
of establishments and companies into industries, improve cov-
erage, and reconcile significant differences in data produced
by the three agencies. (4) To increase understanding of the United States
economy, especially for key industry and regional statistics,
