To ensure compliance with the government standards outlined in the E-Government Act of 2002 from a DevOps perspective, the following actions should be prioritized when managing and designing infrastructure for web applications:

1. **Secure Data Collection and Handling**: Implement measures to secure data collection, processing, and storage within the infrastructure to protect information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

2. **Implement Privacy and Security Protocols**: Align the web application’s data protection policies with federal guidelines, ensuring that all collected data is handled with confidentiality and integrity, as stated under sections like SEC. 208 (Privacy Provisions) in the document.

3. **Promote Interoperability and Usability**: Develop systems using standard, interoperable protocols to facilitate easy access and integration with other government systems, complying with the specifications under the Compatibility (SEC. 203) clause relating to electronic signatures and other interoperability standards outlined in the document.

4. **Infrastructure Scalability and Resilience**: Ensure the web application’s infrastructure is scalable and resilient. Establish guidelines for continuity of operation plans that meet federal standards, aimed at maintaining service in the face of various challenges.

5. **Accessible Web Design**: Design the infrastructure to support accessible web applications complying with SEC. 207 regarding Accessibility, ensuring the application is usable for all individuals, including those with disabilities.

6. **Regular Compliance Audits and Reporting**: Conduct regular audits to ensure continuous compliance with all applicable standards and requirements. Regularly update the security measures and practices in place to reflect new or emerging threats as described in SEC. 3545 (Annual Independent Evaluation).

7. **Documentation and Change Management**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of processes, systems, and procedures used in the application’s deployment and operation. Use effective change management strategies to handle updates and modifications, ensuring compliance throughout the project lifecycle.
