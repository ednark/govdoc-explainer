CONTINGENCY PLAN APPROVALS

Introduction and Purpose
Information systems are vital to CSP Name mission/business functions; therefore, it is critical that services provided by <Insert CSO Name> are able to operate effectively without excessive interruption. This Information Technology Contingency Plan (ISCP) establishes comprehensive procedures to recover <Insert CSO Name> quickly and effectively following a service disruption. One of the goals of an ISCP is to establish procedures and mechanisms that obviate the need to resort to performing IT functions using manual methods. If manual methods are the only alternative, however, every effort must be made to continue IT functions and processes manually. The nature of unprecedented disruptions can create confusion, and often predisposes an otherwise competent IT staff towards less efficient practices.</div><div id="chunk-1" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> In order to maintain a normal level of efficiency, it is important to decrease real-time process engineering by documenting notification and activation guidelines and procedures, recovery guidelines and procedures, and reconstitution guidelines and procedures prior to the occurrence of a disruption. During the notification/activation phase, appropriate personnel are apprised of current conditions and damage assessment begins. During the recovery phase, appropriate personnel take a course of action to recover the <Insert CSO Name> components to a site other than the one that experienced the disruption. In the final, reconstitution phase, actions are taken to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal operations. Applicable Laws and Regulations
A summary of <Insert CSO Name>-specific laws and regulations are available in the System Security Plan (SSP), Appendix L, <Insert CSO Name>-specific Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Guidance. FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance
All FedRAMP documents are available at www.fedramp.gov 
FedRAMP Incident Communications Procedure 
FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy and Guide
<Insert CSO Name> and Identifier
This ISCP applies to the <Insert CSO Name> (Information System Abbreviation), which has a unique identifier as noted in Table 1.3 <Insert CSO Name> and Title. Table 1.3 <Insert CSO Name> and Title
Scope
This ISCP has been developed for <Insert CSO Name>, which is classified as a <specify impact level> impact system, in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199. FIPS 199 provides guidelines on determining potential impact to organizational operations and assets, and individuals through a formula that examines three security objectives: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The procedures in this ISCP have been developed for a <specify level> impact system and are designed to recover the CSO within Recovery Time Objective (RTO) <Enter Number> hours. The replacement or purchase of new equipment, short-term disruptions lasting less than <Enter Number>, or loss of data at the primary facility or at the user-desktop levels is outside the scope of this plan.</div><div id="chunk-2" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Table 1.4 Plans Outside of ISCP Scope below identifies other plans and circumstances that are related but are outside the scope of this ISCP. Table 1.4 Plans Outside of ISCP Scope

Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made about the <Insert CSO Name>: 
The Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) will keep the system up and running after <Enter Number>
The generators will kick in after <Enter Number> from the time of a power failure. Current backups of the application software and data are intact and available at the offsite storage facility in <Enter City, Enter State>. The backup storage capability is approved and has been accepted by the Authorizing Official (AO). The <Insert CSO Name> is inoperable if it cannot be recovered within <Enter Number> RTO hours. Key personnel have been identified and are trained annually in their roles. Key personnel are available to activate the ISCP. CSP Name defines circumstances that can inhibit recovery and reconstitution to a known state. Concept of Operations
This section provides details about the <Insert CSO Name>, an overview of the three phases of the ISCP (Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution), and a description of the roles and responsibilities of key personnel during contingency operations. System Description
Three Phases
This plan has been developed to recover and reconstitute the <Insert CSO Name> using a three-phased approach.</div><div id="chunk-3" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The approach ensures that system recovery and reconstitution efforts are performed in a methodical sequence to maximize the effectiveness of the recovery and reconstitution efforts and minimize system outage time due to errors and omissions. The three system recovery phases consist of activation and notification, recovery, and reconstitution. Activation and Notification Phase. Activation of the ISCP occurs after a disruption, outage, or disaster that may reasonably extend beyond the RTO established for a system. The outage event may result in severe damage to the facility that houses the system, severe damage or loss of equipment, or other damage that typically results in long-term loss. Once the ISCP is activated, the information system stakeholders are notified of a possible long-term outage, and a thorough outage assessment is performed for the information system. Information from the outage assessment is analyzed and may be used to modify recovery procedures specific to the cause of the outage. Recovery Phase. The Recovery phase details the activities and procedures for recovery of the affected system. Activities and procedures are written at a level such that an appropriately skilled technician can recover the system without intimate system knowledge.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> This phase includes notification and awareness escalation procedures for communication of recovery status to system stakeholders. Reconstitution. The Reconstitution phase defines the actions taken to test and validate system capability and functionality at the original or new permanent location. This phase consists of two major activities: validating data and operational functionality followed by deactivation of the plan. During validation, the system is tested and validated as operational prior to returning operation to its normal state. Validation procedures include functionality or regression testing, concurrent processing, and/or data validation. The system is declared recovered and operational upon successful completion of validation testing. Deactivation includes activities to notify users of system operational status. This phase also addresses recovery effort documentation, activity log finalization, incorporation of lessons learned into plan updates, and readying resources for any future events. Data Backup Readiness Information
A common understanding of data backup definitions is necessary in order to ensure that data restoration is successful.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> <Insert CSO Name> recognizes different types of backups, which have different purposes, and those definitions are found in Table 2.1 Backup Types. Table 2.1 Backup Types

The hardware and software components used to create the <Insert CSO Name> backups are noted in Table 2.2 Backup System Components. Table 2.2 Backup System Components

Table 2.3 Back-Up Storage Location shows the offsite storage facility location of current backups of the <Insert CSO Name> system software and data. Table 2.3 Back-Up Storage Location

Personnel who are authorized to retrieve backups from the offsite storage location, and may authorize the delivery of backups, are noted in Appendix C – Section 1: Alternate Storage Site Information. <Insert CSO Name> maintains both an online and offline (portable) set of backup copies of the following types of data on site at their primary location:
User-level information
System-level information
Information system documentation including security information. Site Readiness Information
CSP Name recognizes different types of alternate sites, which are defined in Table 2.4 Alternative Site Types. Table 2.4 Alternative Site Types

Alternate facilities have been established for the <Insert CSO Name> as noted in Table 2.4 Alternative Site Types. Table 2.5 Primary and Alternative Site Locations

Activation Criteria and Procedure
The <Insert CSO Name> ISCP may be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met: 
The type of outage indicates <Insert CSO Name> will be down for more than <Enter Number> RTO hours. The facility housing <Insert CSO Name> is damaged and may not be available within <Enter Number> RTO hours
Other criteria, as appropriate. Personnel/roles listed in Table 3.1 Personnel Authorized to Activate the ISCP are authorized to activate the ISCP. Table 3.1 Personnel Authorized to Activate the ISCP


Notification Instructions

Contact information for key personnel is located in Appendix A – Key Personnel and Team Member Contact List.</div><div id="chunk-8" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Outage Assessment
Following notification, a thorough outage assessment is necessary to determine the extent of the disruption, any damage, and expected recovery time. This outage assessment is conducted by <Insert Role Name>. Assessment results are provided to the Contingency Planning Coordinator to assist in the coordination of the recovery effort. Recovery
The recovery phase provides formal recovery operations that begin after the ISCP has been activated, outage assessments have been completed (if possible), personnel have been notified, and appropriate teams have been mobilized. Recovery phase activities focus on implementing recovery strategies to restore system capabilities, repair damage, and resume operational capabilities at the original or an alternate location. At the completion of the recovery phase, <Insert CSO Name> will be functional and capable of performing the functions identified in Section 4.1 Sequence of Recovery Operations of the plan. Sequence of Recovery Operations
The following activities occur during recovery of <Insert CSO Name>:

Identification of recovery location (if not at original location)
Identification of required resources to perform recovery procedures
Retrieval of backup and system installation media
Recovery of hardware and operating system (if required)
Recovery of system from backup and system installation media
Implementation of transaction recovery for systems that are transaction-based
Recovery Procedures 
The following procedures are provided for recovery of <Insert CSO Name> at the original or established alternate location. Recovery procedures are outlined per team and must be executed in the sequence presented to maintain an efficient recovery effort. Recovery Escalation Notices/Awareness
Notifications during recovery include problem escalation to leadership and status awareness to system owners and users. This section describes the procedures for handling escalation notices that define and describe the events, thresholds, or other types of triggers that may require additional action.</div><div id="chunk-9" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Reconstitution
Reconstitution is the process by which recovery activities are completed and normal system operations are resumed. If the original facility is unrecoverable, the activities in this phase can also be applied to preparing a new permanent location to support system processing requirements. A determination must be made whether the system has undergone significant change and will require reassessment and reauthorization. The phase consists of two major activities: (1) validating successful reconstitution and (2) deactivation of the plan. Concurrent processing is the process of running a system at two separate locations concurrently until there is a level of assurance that the recovered system is operating correctly and securely. Data Validation Testing
Validation data testing is the process of testing and validating data to ensure that data files or databases have been recovered completely at the permanent location. Functional Validation Testing
Functionality testing is a process for verifying that all system functionality has been tested, and the system is ready to return to normal operations. Recovery Declaration
Upon successfully completing testing and validation, the <Insert Role Name> will formally declare recovery efforts complete, and that <Insert CSO Name> is in normal operations. <Insert CSO Name> business and technical POCs will be notified of the declaration by the Contingency Plan Coordinator. The recovery declaration statement notifies the Contingency Plan Team and executive management that the <Insert CSO Name> has returned to normal operations.</div><div id="chunk-10" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> User Notification
After the recovery declaration statement is made, notifications are sent to users and customers. Notifications to customers are made in accordance with predetermined notification procedures. Cleanup
Cleanup is the process of cleaning up or dismantling any temporary recovery locations, restocking supplies used, returning manuals or other documentation to their original locations, and readying the system for a possible future contingency event. Table 5.1 Cleanup Roles and Responsibilities
Returning Backup Media
It is important that all backup and installation media used during recovery be returned to the off-site data storage location. The following procedures must be followed to return backup and installation media to its offsite data storage location: <Inset Procedures>
Backing-Up Restored Systems
As soon as reasonable following recovery, the system must be fully backed up and a new copy of the current operating system stored for future recovery efforts. This full backup is then kept with other system backups. The procedures for conducting a full system backup are: <Inset Procedures>
Event Documentation
It is important that all recovery events be well-documented, including actions taken and problems encountered during the recovery and reconstitution effort. Information on lessons learned must be included in the annual update to the ISCP. It is the responsibility of each ISCP team or person to document their actions during the recovery event. Table 5.2 Event Documentation Responsibility lists the responsibility of each ISCP team or person to document their actions during the recovery event. Table 5.2 Event Documentation Responsibility
Contingency Plan Testing
Contingency Plan operational tests of the <Insert CSO Name> are performed annually.</div><div id="chunk-11" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> A Contingency Plan Test Report is documented after each annual test.
