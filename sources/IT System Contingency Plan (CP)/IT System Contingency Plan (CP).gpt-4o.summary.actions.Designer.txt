Certainly! Here is a minimal list of actions a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design should focus on to ensure compliance with government standards for a web application:

1. **Accessibility Compliance (Section 508/WCAG)**:
   - Ensure all interface elements (buttons, links, forms) are accessible via keyboard navigation.
   - Use sufficient color contrast for text and background elements.
   - Implement alt text for all images and non-text content.
   - Ensure proper labels and instructions for all form fields.

2. **User Authentication and Privacy**:
   - Design user registration and login forms that adhere to security guidelines (e.g., use HTTPS).
   - Provide clear, concise privacy notices and consent forms (e.g., for cookies, data collection).
   - Design intuitive logout mechanisms and account management interfaces.

3. **Consistent User Interface Standards**:
   - Maintain a consistent look and feel across all pages and sections of the application.
   - Use standard navigation structures and elements that users are familiar with.
   - Implement error messages and notifications that are clear and helpful for users.

4. **Contingency Plan Awareness**:
   - Design user communication flows for notifying users during outages or disruptions.
   - Ensure easy-to-find help and support options in the UI.
   - Create a user-friendly FAQ or knowledge base section for common issues and recovery instructions.

5. **Testing and Feedback**:
   - Conduct usability testing sessions with diverse user groups, including individuals with disabilities.
   - Incorporate user feedback loops within the application (e.g., "Feedback" buttons).
   - Regularly update the design based on feedback and compliance testing results.

6. **Data Protection by Design**:
   - Minimize data collection to only what is necessary for the functionality.
   - Ensure forms and inputs only request information that is absolutely necessary.
   - Design easy-to-use data management options for users (e.g., account deletion, data export).

By focusing on these actions, a Designer working on the User Experience and User Interface can help ensure that the web application adheres to the necessary government standards.
