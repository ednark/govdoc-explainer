Certainly! Here’s a minimal list of actions a Drupal Developer should take to ensure compliance with government standards for a web application, focusing on backend business logic:

1. **Data Backup Implementation:**
   - Implement regular automated backups of the database and site files.
   - Store backups at an offsite/alternative secure location.
  
2. **Secure Data Transmission:**
   - Ensure that data transmitted via the web application uses HTTPS/TLS encryption.
   
3. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Configure and enforce Drupal’s role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data and functionality access based on user roles.
   
4. **Data Validation and Sanitization:**
   - Implement thorough data validation and sanitization measures to prevent injection attacks and maintain data integrity.

5. **Incident Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Enable and configure detailed logging for all significant actions and events within the application.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms for key system events.

6. **Disaster Recovery and Downtime Reasoning:**
   - Develop and document procedures for switching to a failover site (if available).
   - Implement recovery scripts that restore data and functionality from backup.

7. **Security Updates and Patching:**
   - Regularly apply Drupal core and module security updates.
   - Monitor and apply necessary patches to underlying server infrastructure as needed.

8. **System Testing and Validation:**
   - Develop scripts/tests to validate data integrity and functionality after any recovery or failover event.
   - Regularly test the contingency plan procedures to ensure their effectiveness.

9. **User Authentication:**
   - Configure strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for accessing administrative interfaces.
   
10. **Documentation of Data Flow and Dependencies:**
    - Document the data flow and dependencies between different components of the Drupal application to ensure clear understanding during recovery.

11. **Configuration Management:**
    - Maintain version control for all Drupal configurations and custom code. Use Drupal’s Configuration Management System.

12. **Compliance with Development Practices:**
    - Follow secure coding practices and review the government’s recommended guidelines, such as those from OWASP, for web applications.

By adhering to these practices, a Drupal Developer can contribute significantly to compliance with government standards for a secure and resilient web application.
