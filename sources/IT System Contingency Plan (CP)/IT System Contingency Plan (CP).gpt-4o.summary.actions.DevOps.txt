Certainly! Hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions a DevOps technician should take to ensure compliance with relevant government standards for a web application:

### Initial Preparation
1. **Backup Configuration**
   - Set up regular, automated backups for user-level information, system-level information, and system documentation.
   - Store backups both on-site and at an approved offsite location.

### Infrastructure and System Setup
2. **Redundant Power Supply**
   - Equip infrastructure with Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).
   - Verify generators activate within the required time frame.
   
3. **Alternate Site Readiness**
   - Ensure an alternate site is prepared, ensuring network and power readiness.
   - Maintain an inventory of hardware and software at both primary and alternate sites.

### Monitoring and Incident Response
4. **System Monitoring**
   - Implement continuous monitoring for system health and potential outages.
   - Establish alert mechanisms to notify relevant personnel immediately upon detection of an issue.

5. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Document and implement procedures for incident detection, assessment, and notification.
   - Conduct regular testing and validation of the incident response plan.

### Recovery Procedures
6. **Recovery Sequence and Resources**
   - Define and document the sequence of recovery operations for all critical components.
   - Ensure backup and installation media are clearly identified and accessible.

7. **Telecommunications Setup**
   - Configure alternate communication methods (VOIP, Internet) and ensure readiness at the alternate site.

### Documentation and Compliance
8. **System Documentation**
   - Maintain updated documentation of the system configuration, roles, and responsibilities.

9. **Regular Review and Testing**
   - Perform annual tests of the contingency plan and document results.
   - Update the contingency plan based on lessons learned and changes in the system.

### Communication
10. **Notification and Communication Channels**
    - Establish and ensure a clear communication plan for internal and external stakeholders in case of a disruption.
    - Maintain an updated contact list for key personnel and vendors.

These actions cover the key compliance requirements from a DevOps perspective, ensuring that system recovery, data integrity, and continuous operations are maintained according to government standards.
