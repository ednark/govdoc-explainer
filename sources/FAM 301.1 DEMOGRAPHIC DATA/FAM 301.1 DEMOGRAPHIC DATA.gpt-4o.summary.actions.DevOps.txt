Certainly! Here is a minimal list of actions that a DevOps technician must take to ensure compliance with the relevant government standards for a web application:

1. **Data Privacy and Separation**:
   - Implement automated data processing systems that segregate demographic data from personnel records.

2. **Secure Data Collection**:
   - Ensure that systems used for data collection meet EEOC standards for maintaining privacy and security.
   - Use encryption to protect data at rest and in transit.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Set up role-based access control to limit who can access sensitive data.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication for users accessing sensitive data.

4. **Data Reporting**:
   - Configure systems to generate and transmit reports on race, national origin, sex, and disability statistics as required by the EEOC.

5. **Data Accuracy**:
   - Develop and deploy notifications to remind users of the importance of accurate data entry for demographic information.
   - Implement validation checks to flag potentially inaccurate data for review.

6. **Audit Trails**:
   - Maintain audit logs of all access and changes to demographic data.
   - Ensure these logs are stored securely and are tamper-proof for compliance audits.

7. **No Quotas**:
   - Ensure that application logic and data storage do not include features that set quotas based on race, color, national origin, sex, or religion.

8. **Compliance Review and Documentation**:
   - Regularly review and document compliance with EEOC guidelines and any modifications approved by the EEOC.
   - Prepare infrastructure and processes for potential audits by the EEOC or other federal entities.

By taking these actions, a DevOps technician can ensure that the infrastructure supports compliance with the government standards outlined in the provided document.
