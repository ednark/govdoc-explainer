Certainly! Here is a concise list of actions for a Project Manager to ensure compliance with the Government Standards Document for a web application project:

1. **System Setup for Data Collection:**
   - Establish a robust system to collect employment information on race, national origin, sex, and disabilities.

2. **Data Privacy Compliance:**
   - Ensure the automated data processing system adheres to EEOC standards for individual privacy.

3. **Voluntary Self-Identification:**
   - Implement mechanisms for employees to voluntarily self-identify their race, national origin, sex, and disabilities.

4. **Advisory Notifications:**
   - Create standard advisory messages to inform employees about the importance of providing demographic data and the obligation to report it.

5. **Visual Identification Process:**
   - Develop a process for visual identification and informing employees if they decline to provide demographic information.

6. **Accuracy Assurance:**
   - Establish a procedure to advise employees of the need for accurate data collection solely for statistical purposes, and the protection of their data.

7. **Approved Categories and Procedures:**
   - Use only EEOC-prescribed categories for race, national origin and approved data collection/maintenance procedures.

8. **Exception Handling:**
   - Prepare a protocol to seek advance written approval from the EEOC for any procedural exceptions.

9. **Non-quota Compliance:**
   - Ensure that data usage for studies and analyses does not establish employment quotas based on race, color, national origin, sex, or religion.

10. **Reporting Setup:**
    - Set up reporting mechanisms to provide required demographic data to relevant federal entities (EEOC, OPM, Congress, White House).

11. **Record-Based Disability Identification:**
    - Implement a process for identifying disabilities from appointment records if the employee appointed under special authority refuses to self-identify.

12. **Unknown Disability Reporting:**
    - Plan for procedures to report unknown disability status if employees refuse to provide information or if data accuracy is in question.

By organizing and tracking these actions, a Project Manager can guide the team effectively toward compliance with the government standards outlined in the document.
