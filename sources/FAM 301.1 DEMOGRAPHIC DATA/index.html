a. The Department has established a system to collect
and maintain accurate employment information on the race, national origin, sex
and disabilities of its employees. b. The information collected under this section will be
reported only in the form of gross statistics. The Department will not collect
or maintain any information on the race, national origin, sex or disability of
individual employees except when an automated data processing system is used in
accordance with standards and requirements prescribed by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to ensure individual privacy and the separation of
that information from personnel records. c.  The Department will report to the EEOC, the Office

voluntarily provide the requested information, the Department will advise the
employee of the importance of the data and of the Department's obligation to
report it. If the employee still refuses to provide the information, the
Department must make visual identification and inform the employee of the data
it will be reporting.</div><div id="chunk-2" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> b. If the Department believes that information provided
by an employee is inaccurate, the Department will advise the employee that the
data is collected solely for statistical purposes, the need for accuracy, the
Department's recognition of the sensitivity of the information, and the
existence of procedures to prevent its unauthorized disclosure. If, thereafter,
the employee declines to change the potentially inaccurate self-identification,
the agency must accept it. c.  Only those categories of race and national origin
prescribed by the EEOC may be used. d. Only the specific procedures for the collection and
maintenance of data that are prescribed or approved by the EEOC may be used. e. The Department may make an exception to the
prescribed procedures and requirements only with the advance written approval
of the EEOC. f.  The Department may use the collected data only in
studies and analyses, which contribute affirmatively to achieving the
objectives of the equal employment opportunity program. g. The Department will not establish a quota for the
