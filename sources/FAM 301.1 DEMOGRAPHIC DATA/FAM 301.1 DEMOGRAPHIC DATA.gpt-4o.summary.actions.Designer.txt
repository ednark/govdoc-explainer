1. **Voluntary Self-Identification Forms:** Provide clear, opt-in forms for users to voluntarily self-identify their race, national origin, sex, and disabilities.

2. **Privacy Information:** Include clear privacy statements that inform users about how their data will be used, stored, and protected.

3. **User Communication:** Design notifications to inform users of the importance of their demographic information and the Department's obligation to collect it when applicable.

4. **Error Handling:** Implement user-friendly messages that appear if demographic data submitted by users appears inaccurate, explaining the need for accuracy and confidentiality.

5. **Visual Identification Notice:** Create a transparent process for informing employees if visual identification will be used for data collection, explaining why this step is necessary if they do not provide the information voluntarily.

6. **EEOC Compliance:** Ensure that the design of forms and data collection processes adhere to categories and procedures prescribed or approved by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

7. **Accessibility Features:** Make forms accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, ensuring compliance with relevant accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).

8. **Inclusivity in Design:** Ensure that all race, national origin, and sex categories prescribed by the EEOC are represented clearly in the UI to promote inclusivity.

9. **Data Usage Disclosure:** Display information on how the collected data will only be used in studies and analyses to support equal employment opportunity objectives.

10. **Security Measures:** Implement front-end security features to protect the collected demographic data from unauthorized access.

Remember, while these steps focus on the designerâ€™s role, coordination with developers, policy experts, and data privacy officers is essential to full compliance.
