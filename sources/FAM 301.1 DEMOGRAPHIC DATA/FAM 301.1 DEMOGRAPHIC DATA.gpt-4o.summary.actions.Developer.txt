Certainly! Here is a minimal list of actions a Drupal developer should take to ensure compliance with the relevant government standards as described in the document:

1. **Implement Voluntary Self-Identification Forms:**
   - Create forms to collect race, national origin, sex, and disability information, ensuring that submission is optional.

2. **Ensure Data Privacy:**
   - Implement database encryption and access control to maintain the confidentiality of demographic and disability data.

3. **Use Automated Data Processing Standards:**
   - Follow EEOC standards for automated data processing to protect individual privacy.

4. **Provide Gross Statistics Reporting:**
   - Ensure that data is aggregated and reported only in the form of gross statistics without linking to individual identities.

5. **Handle Missing Information:**
   - Implement logic to visually identify race, national origin, and sex if an employee refuses to self-identify and inform them of the recorded data.

6. **Respect Categories Prescribed by EEOC:**
   - Limit race and national origin data to EEOC-prescribed categories.

7. **Follow Specific EEOC Procedures:**
   - Implement data collection and maintenance procedures as prescribed or approved by the EEOC.

8. **Label Disability Status as 'Unknown':**
   - If an employee does not self-identify their disability or provides inaccurate information, mark their status as 'unknown' unless supported by special appointment records.

9. **Disable Quota Features:**
   - Ensure that no business logic or application feature establishes quotas based on the collected demographic or disability data.

By following these steps, the Drupal developer would help ensure that the web application complies with the specified government standards for data collection and privacy.
