Here is a minimal list for a DevOps technician to show compliance with FedRAMP standards in a web application project:

1. **Use FedRAMP-Authorized Services**:
   - Ensure all cloud services and providers are FedRAMP authorized.

2. **Implement Strong Access Controls**:
   - Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).

3. **Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scans**:
   - Schedule and perform regular web application, database, and infrastructure vulnerability scans.
   - Document and remediate identified vulnerabilities.

4. **Perform Penetration Testing**:
   - Facilitate annual penetration testing.
   - Address identified risks and document remediation actions.

5. **Maintain Security Configurations**:
   - Use secure configurations for servers, databases, and network devices.
   - Regularly review and update security configurations.

6. **Implement Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Set up continuous monitoring for security events and incidents.
   - Document all monitoring activities as required by the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Performance Management Guide.

7. **Manage and Review Logs**:
   - Collect, store, and regularly review security logs.
   - Ensure logs are immutable and stored securely.

8. **Document System Interconnections**:
   - Maintain updated documentation of all system interconnections and external services.

9. **Handle Configuration Management**:
   - Keep an up-to-date inventory of system components.
   - Document and review configuration changes.

10. **Deploy Patches and Updates Effectively**:
    - Ensure timely deployment of system patches and updates.
    - Track and document patch management activities.

11. **Backup and Recovery**:
    - Implement regular data backup procedures.
    - Test recovery procedures periodically to ensure data integrity.

12. **Zero Trust Implementation**:
    - Follow CISA Zero Trust Architecture guidelines.
    - Assume potential threats and validate all requests within the system.

13. **Authentication and Encryption**:
    - Use strong encryption for data at rest and in transit.
    - Ensure proper implementation of authentication protocols.

By following these steps, a DevOps technician can ensure the infrastructure supporting the web application maintains compliance with FedRAMP standards.
