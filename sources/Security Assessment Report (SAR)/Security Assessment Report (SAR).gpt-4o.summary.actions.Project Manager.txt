From the perspective of a project manager tracking and organizing work for a web application to ensure compliance with FedRAMP standards, hereâ€™s a minimal list of necessary actions:

1. **Initiate Planning:**
   - Ensure initial FedRAMP authorization process is included in the project plan.
   - Engage a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO (Third Party Assessment Organization).
   - Develop a Security Assessment Plan (SAP).

2. **Baseline Assessment:**
   - Conduct an initial security assessment of the web application.
   - Document results in the Security Assessment Report (SAR).

3. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Set up a Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) for continuous monitoring.
   - Schedule and conduct annual assessments of core controls.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain accurate and current documentation, including System Security Plan (SSP) and assessment results.
   - Use and adhere to FedRAMP provided templates for all documentation.

5. **Risk Management:**
   - Identify, document, and manage risks in the Risk Exposure Table (RET).
   - Validate and track mitigation of open risks, including operational requirements (ORs) and vendor dependencies (VDs).

6. **Vulnerability Management:**
   - Schedule and track vulnerability scans (web application, database, infrastructure, etc.).
   - Ensure remediation of identified vulnerabilities and document any false positives.

7. **Change Management:**
   - Track and manage significant changes in the web application.
   - Document and assess changes in the SAR when they occur.

8. **Penetration Testing:**
   - Schedule and oversee regular penetration testing.
   - Document results and track remediation efforts.

9. **Zero-Trust Architecture:**
   - Ensure alignment with CISA Zero Trust Architecture Model.
   - Implement zero-trust principles and document as part of continuous monitoring.

10. **Client Coordination:**
    - Continuously engage with the client to ensure their awareness and involvement in compliance activities.
    - Provide periodic updates on compliance status and progress.

By focusing on these actionable items, a project manager can methodically track and ensure compliance with FedRAMP standards for a web application project.
