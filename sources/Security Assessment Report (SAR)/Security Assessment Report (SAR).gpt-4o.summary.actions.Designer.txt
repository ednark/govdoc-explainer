From the perspective of a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design and responsible for the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) of the application, here is a minimal list of actions to show compliance with standards:

1. **Ensure Accessibility Compliance**:
   - Follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for designing the UI to be accessible to users with disabilities.
   - Use semantic HTML elements to improve screen reader support.
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., images, videos).
   - Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards.

2. **Implement Security Best Practices in Design**:
   - Avoid placing sensitive information in the UI where it can be easily accessed.
   - Design forms to include visual indicators for validation and error messages.

3. **Follow Privacy Design Principles**:
   - Incorporate “Privacy by Design” practices, ensuring that user privacy is considered in every aspect of the design process.
   - Simplify privacy policies and make them easily accessible to users.

4. **Adhere to Usability Standards**:
   - Conduct user research and usability testing to validate design decisions and ensure the application is user-friendly.
   - Follow best practices for navigation and layout consistency.
   - Ensure the design supports intuitive user workflows.

5. **Collect and Document User Feedback**:
   - Collect feedback from real users to identify potential usability issues and areas of improvement.
   - Document the feedback process and how user insights influenced design decisions.

6. **Maintain a Detailed Design System**:
   - Create and maintain a design system that documents all UI components and their usage guidelines.
   - Ensure consistency across the application by adhering to the design system.

7. **Keep Abreast of FedRAMP Requirements**:
   - Be aware of FedRAMP-specific design considerations, especially those related to secure and transparent design elements.
   - Implement visual cues that comply with FedRAMP's emphasis on security, such as clear login/logout indicators.

By following this list, a Designer will contribute to the web application’s compliance with relevant standards from a UX/UI perspective.
