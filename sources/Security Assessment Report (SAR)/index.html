Introduction
About This Document
This document is developed as a template when creating a FedRAMP Security Assessment Report (SAR). This template should be used for all initial authorization assessments, annual assessments, combined annual assessments (i.e., JAB annual assessments that may also include significant change assessments), and significant change assessments. Independent assessors (IAs) must complete this SAR template based upon a specific cloud service offering’s (CSO’s) security assessment as captured in the CSO’s security assessment plan (SAP). This SAR documents the risk posture for a CSO based on a point-in-time security assessment. A CSP must keep in mind that an IA must follow all FedRAMP requirements in preparing this SAR. Failure to follow FedRAMP requirements may result in retesting, delaying the authorization process.</div><div id="chunk-1" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This document uses the term authorizing official (AO). For systems pursuing a Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO), AO refers to the JAB. For systems pursuing a FedRAMP Agency Authorization, AO refers to each leveraging agency’s AO. Who Should Use This Document? This SAR template is intended to be populated by a FedRAMP recognized third party assessment organization (3PAO) or an independent assessment organization (IAO) when documenting the results of a FedRAMP security assessment. AOs will review this completed SAR to make risk-based authorization decisions. CSPs pursuing a JAB P-ATO are required to use a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO to conduct the security assessment. It is incumbent upon a CSP to ensure that their 3PAO assessors hold the appropriate certifications and have the required years of experience (see Section 6.1 of the FedRAMP SAP template). CSPs pursuing a FedRAMP Agency Authorization may use other IAOs, if directed to do so by their agency partner; however, the use of a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO is encouraged. If an agency elects to use their own IA team or a third-party assessor, that is not a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO, the agency AO must attest to the independence of the assessment organization.</div><div id="chunk-2" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> In addition, the IAO must always use FedRAMP provided templates. Throughout the remainder of this template, an assessor subcontracted with/employed by either a FedRAMP recognized 3PAO or an independent assessment organization (IAO) will be collectively referred to as an “IA”. Executive Summary
Table - <Insert CSP Name>, <Insert CSO Name> Information


This is <Choose One: an initial assessment/an annual assessment/a combined annual assessment and significant change assessment/a significant change assessment> SAR as required by FedRAMP. This SAR aggregates the results of the required FedRAMP security assessment of the <Insert CSO Name> environment as recorded in the <Insert CSO Name> <Choose One: SSP/SSP and significant change documentation/significant change documentation>. All identified findings are recorded in the SAR Appendix A, Risk Exposure Table (RET). The RET documents all open risks that remained at the conclusion of the assessment, including all risk adjustments (RAs), operational requirements (ORs), and vendor dependencies (VDs). These are identified in the “Risk Exposure Table (RET)” tab. Risks validated as closed, during the assessment, are identified in the “Risks Corrected During Testing” tab. The assessment took place from <Choose One: for initial testing window MM/DD/YYYY to MM/DD/YYYY and remediation testing window MM/DD/YYYY to MM/DD/YYYY/this assessment began MM/DD/YYYY and ended MM/DD/YYYY>. Initial Assessment:
This report is for an initial assessment of <Insert CSO Name>, a <Choose One: High/Moderate/ Low> baseline system.</div><div id="chunk-3" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> 100% of the FedRAMP security controls in the system baseline are assessed. The security controls that will be assessed are listed in Appendix A of the SAP. Annual Assessment:
This report is for an annual assessment of <Insert CSO Name>, a <Choose One: High/Moderate/ Low> baseline system. After the initial security assessment, FedRAMP requires that the system is assessed annually, thereafter (12 months from an agency ATO / JAB P-ATO date). While the entire set of security controls is assessed during the initial assessment, a subset is assessed during the annual assessment. The control selection is in accordance with the criteria outlined in the FedRAMP Annual Assessment Guidance and includes: 
Core controls (required annually)
CSP-selected controls required to address system changes that have been implemented and/or changed by the CSP since the last assessment. This excludes those controls or portions of controls previously assessed under a significant change within the same annual period. Validation of Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&Ms) closed since the last assessment
Validation of POA&Ms identified as vendor dependencies (VDs) or deviation requests (DRs)
CSP-selected controls identified as “Not Applicable” (N/A) to validate they are, in fact, not applicable
Controls that have not been assessed, at least once in a three-year period, to ensure controls are meeting periodicity requirements
The detailed control list, including the rationale for each control’s selection, is included in SAP Appendix A, FedRAMP <Insert CSO Name> Security Controls Selection Worksheet. Significant Change:
This report <Choose One: is for/also includes> the assessment completed for <Choose One: a significant change/several significant changes>. The <Insert CSO Name> SAP, Appendix D includes the significant change request documentation submitted by <Insert CSP Name> to the <Choose One: AO/JAB>.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Appendix A includes the associated control selections. <Insert IA Name> did evaluate (review and/or test), as necessary, <Choose one: all items related to continuous monitoring activities/all items related to continuous monitoring activities as well as those that are applicable to the significant change assessment/continuous monitoring activities that are applicable to the significant change assessment. <Insert IA Name> did evaluate all open POA&M items (including VDs); POA&M closures (to confirm adequate closure) and validate and confirm continued relevance and applicability of DRs ((false positives (FPs), risk adjustments (RAs), and operational requirements (ORs)) <Choose One (if significant change(s) are included): including those applicable to the significant change assessment/applicable to the significant change assessment>. Below is a summary of risks that remained open at the conclusion of this assessment. Refer to the Appendix A RET workbook for additional details. Table - Summary of Risks That Remained Open at the Conclusion of this Assessment

* ORs are considered open risks and are counted in the total number of risks identified for a system. A CSP should be seeking ways to mitigate or eliminate the risks associated with ORs. **VDs are considered open risks that must be counted in the total number of risks identified for a system. A CSP should be actively seeking ways to mitigate or eliminate the risks associated with VDs. If a VD is ongoing, a CSP may have to migrate to a different technology/vendor.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Details of the assessment approach are documented in the SAP, <Insert Version X.X>, dated <Insert MM/DD/YYYY>. Any deviations from the approved SAP are noted in Table 4-1, List of Assessment Deviations, below. The following were completed for this assessment: <Choose all that apply: manual testing/penetration testing/ web application vulnerability scans/database vulnerability scans/operating system vulnerability scans/container vulnerability scans>. <Insert IA Name> recommends this system for authorization. <Insert IA Name> does not recommend this system for authorization. <Insert IA Name> recommends this system for continued authorization. <Insert IA Name> does not recommend this system for continued authorization. <Insert IA Name> recommends the following <Choose One: significant change/significant change(s)> included in this assessment for authorization:

The SRTM
Risks identified by <Insert IA Name> through security control testing are recorded in the <Insert CSO Name> Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) workbook. As described in Section 4.4 below, risks identified (i) in the SRTM, (ii) through penetration testing, (iii) through vulnerability scanning, and (iv) through manual testing criteria are documented in the RET. Consideration of Threats
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are working to move the U.S. government toward a zero-trust architecture, where it must be presumed that anything may present a threat. Agencies must work with their CSOs to follow the CISA Zero Trust Architecture Model plans for implementing zero trust architecture. Document Results
The SAR Appendix A, RET contains the details of the system risks identified during the assessment, including:
All security controls failures noted in the SRTM 

 All penetration testing failures

All vulnerabilities detected during scanning

All weaknesses identified during manual testing (other than penetration testing)
Risks Known for Interconnected Systems and External Services

Inherent relationships between <Insert CSO Name> and other interconnected systems may impact the overall system security posture. External services that are used to provide functionality to <Insert CSO Name> or used to manage and operate <Insert CSO Name> may also impact the overall system security posture (e.g.</div><div id="chunk-8" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> the extent to which data/metadata contained in the external service might be leveraged to exploit the main cloud service offering). Risks associated with interconnected systems, external systems/services, interconnections, APIs, and CLIs are documented in the RET. Risk Exposure Table

Infrastructure Scan Results
Infrastructure scanning includes servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, services and management tools that support the computing requirements of a cloud computing model. Cloud infrastructure also includes a layer of programming (hardware abstraction layer or HAL) that allows a computer operating system to interact with a hardware device at a general or abstract level rather than at a detailed hardware level. HAL virtualizes and logically presents resources and services to users through application programming interfaces (APIs) and API-enabled command-line or graphical interfaces. An API is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. <Insert Scanner Name, Vendor, and Version X.X> was used to scan the <Insert CSO Name> infrastructure.</div><div id="chunk-9" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> <Insert Percentage>% of the inventory was scanned. <Include the following if true> For the remaining inventory, the <Insert IA Name> performed a manual review of configuration files to analyze for existing vulnerabilities.
