Considering the perspective of a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design (HCD), the minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with the Government Standards Document for a web application project would include:

1. **Understand Data Policies**:
   - Familiarize with the Data Management Policies (20 FAM 103) to ensure UI/UX design aligns with data compliance requirements.

2. **Ensure Accessibility**:
   - Integrate accessibility features as specified in government web standards to meet requirements for users with disabilities.

3. **Data Purpose Clarity**:
   - Clearly display the purpose of data collection on user interfaces, in line with data documentation regulations.

4. **Consistency in Data Presentation**:
   - Use standardized formats and authoritative data sources for all data presented to users, ensuring consistency and reliability.

5. **Tag Data Sources**:
   - Label data displayed on interfaces with their source and purpose, adhering to documentation guidelines.

6. **User Education**:
   - Design interfaces that educate users about data use and management policies through tooltips, help sections, and guides.

7. **User Data Control**:
   - Provide users with clear options and controls for managing their data, ensuring compliance with data usage policies.

8. **Privacy Notices**:
   - Integrate privacy notices and consent forms into the user flow, informing users of data collection practices in compliance with standards.

9. **Optimize Code Annotations**:
   - Collaborate with developers to ensure code related to the UI/UX is clean, well-documented, and aligned with data use purposes.

10. **Feedback Mechanism**:
    - Include a feedback mechanism for users to report issues or concerns related to data management directly through the application.

By focusing on these actions, the Designer can help ensure that the web application's user experience adheres to the relevant government data management standards.
