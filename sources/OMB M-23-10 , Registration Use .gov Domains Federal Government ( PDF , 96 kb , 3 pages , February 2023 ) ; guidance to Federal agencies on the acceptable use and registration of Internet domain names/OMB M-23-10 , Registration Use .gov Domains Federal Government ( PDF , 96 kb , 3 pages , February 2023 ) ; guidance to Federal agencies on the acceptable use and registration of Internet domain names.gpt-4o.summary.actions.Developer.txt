For a Drupal Developer focusing on backend business logic, here are the minimal actions to ensure compliance with the government standards outlined in the memorandum:

1. **Use .gov Domain**:
   Ensure the web application is hosted on a .gov domain for all official communications, information, and services.

2. **Domain Registration Approval**:
   Verify that the domain name has been approved by the agency’s Chief Information Officer (CIO).

3. **Domain Description Document**:
   Ensure a detailed description is provided for the domain’s purpose, intended audience, and compliance with OMB policies.

4. **Non-.gov Domain Reporting**:
   Report any non-.gov domains or hostnames used by internet-accessible information systems as required by M-22-09.

5. **Compliance with .gov Registry Requirements**:
   Follow the process and domain name requirements stated on the .gov Registry site for domain registration or renewal.

6. **Avoid Domain Conflicts**:
   Be mindful of potential domain name conflicts with other agencies and ensure the domain is aligned with its intended use.

7. **Security Measures**:
   Implement security measures based on Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles for any third-party services.

These steps help ensure the backend logic and the infrastructure of the application adhere to the federal standards for .gov domains.
