To ensure compliance with government standards for a web application project, a project manager should track and organize the following actions:

1. **Domain Name Registration:**
   - Ensure that the application uses a .gov or .mil domain for official communications and services.

2. **Approval and Documentation:**
   - Obtain approval from the agency’s Chief Information Officer or head of the agency for the .gov domain.
   - Prepare detailed documentation, including the purpose, intended audience, necessity, and compliance with OMB policies.

3. **Domain Review:**
   - Review previously registered domains within 180 days to ensure they comply with current requirements.
   - Identify and report any non-compliant domains to OMB.

4. **Third-Party Service Reporting:**
   - Report any usage of non-.gov domains utilized by third-party services (e.g., social media, code collaboration).

5. **Maintain Domain Inventory:**
   - Register new domains as needed, reuse existing domains where possible, and retire unused domains to maintain an up-to-date domain inventory.

6. **OMB Review Coordination:**
   - Coordinate with OMB for domain requests and be prepared to provide additional information if requested.

7. **Compliance Check:**
   - Regularly check the .gov Registry’s site for any updates or additional requirements and ensure adherence.

8. **Issue Resolution:**
   - Promptly address any potential domain-naming conflicts or confusion issues identified by OMB.

9. **Continual Reporting:**
   - Continue reporting the status and usage of all domains as required by M-22-09 or subsequent memos.

By tracking these actions, a project manager can ensure the web application project meets the federal government's .gov domain compliance standards.
