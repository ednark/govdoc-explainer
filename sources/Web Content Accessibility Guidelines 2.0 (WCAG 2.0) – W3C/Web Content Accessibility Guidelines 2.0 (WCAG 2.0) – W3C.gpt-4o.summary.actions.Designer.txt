To ensure compliance with WCAG 2.0 within a web application from the perspective of a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design for User Experience and User Interface, follow this minimal list of actions:

1. **Text Alternatives**:
   - Provide text alternatives for all non-text content (images, icons, etc.).

2. **Captions and Audio Descriptions**:
   - Ensure captions are provided for all prerecorded audio and video content.
   - Incorporate audio descriptions for video content where necessary.

3. **Keyboard Accessibility**:
   - Ensure that all functionality is operable through a keyboard interface.

4. **Time-Based Media Alternatives**:
   - Offer alternatives for time-based media, like transcripts for audio content.

5. **Contrast and Color**:
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background (minimum ratio of 4.5:1).
   - Avoid using color as the sole means of conveying information.

6. **Resizable Text**:
   - Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of functionality or content.

7. **Navigation Aids**:
   - Provide clear and consistent navigation.
   - Use descriptive headings and labels.

8. **Readable Content**:
   - Use simple, readable, and understandable text.
   - Define the language of the page and any specific sections.

9. **Avoid Seizure Triggers**:
   - Do not include content that flashes more than three times in any one second period.

10. **Assistive Technology Compatibility**:
    - Ensure that all elements (forms, links, buttons) have names and roles that can be programmatically determined.

11. **Error Identification and Correction**:
    - Provide clear labels and instructions for user inputs.
    - Offer helpful suggestions and actions when input errors are detected.

12. **Consistent Operation**:
    - Maintain predictable navigation and UI components throughout the site.

13. **Adjustable Timing**:
    - Provide users with options to adjust or disable time limits on content use.

Following these streamlined actions will greatly help in designing a user interface that adheres to WCAG 2.0 guidelines and is accessible to a wider range of users.
