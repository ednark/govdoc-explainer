To ensure compliance with government standards for a web application from a DevOps perspective, focus on the following actions:

1. **Accessibility Infrastructure**:
   - Ensure all environments (dev, staging, production) support accessibility standards.

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Integrate automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse) into your CI/CD pipeline.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Set up monitoring to detect accessibility issues using tools like Siteimprove or Dynomapper.
   - Log accessibility errors and warnings for continuous auditing.

4. **Performance and Accessibility**:
   - Optimize loading times to improve readability and usability.
   - Ensure infrastructure accommodates heavy traffic without degrading accessibility features.

5. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Implement infrastructure protocols to support keyboard navigation and screen reader functionality.
   - Ensure infrastructure supports ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks and roles.

6. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
   - Use CDN to ensure fast and reliable delivery of accessible content globally.

7. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Ensure frequent backups of accessibility features and configurations.
   - Implement disaster recovery plans that restore accessibility compliance swiftly.

8. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement accessible CAPTCHA alternatives, such as hCaptcha or audio-based CAPTCHAs.

9. **Server Configuration**:
   - Configure servers to handle requests in a manner that supports accessible content rendering, such as enabling gzip compression and proper caching mechanisms.

10. **Compliance Documentation**:
    - Maintain documentation of accessibility infrastructure and standards compliance.
    - Regularly update and audit this documentation to ensure ongoing compliance with the latest standards.

By focusing on these key areas, a DevOps technician can help ensure that the web application infrastructure meets necessary accessibility standards.
