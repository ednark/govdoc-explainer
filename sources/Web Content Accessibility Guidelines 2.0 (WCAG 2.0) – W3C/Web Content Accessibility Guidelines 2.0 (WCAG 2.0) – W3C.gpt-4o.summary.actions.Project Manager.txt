Certainly! Here's a concise list of minimal actions a project manager can track to show compliance with WCAG 2.0 standards for a web application:

1. **Establish Requirements:**
   - Document all relevant WCAG 2.0 guidelines applicable to the project.
   - Identify the conformance level (A, AA, or AAA) required for the project.

2. **Accessibility Audit:**
   - Conduct an initial WCAG 2.0 compliance audit of existing content.
   - Identify areas of non-compliance and create a report.

3. **Team Training:**
   - Ensure that the development and content teams are trained in WCAG 2.0 guidelines.

4. **Design Phase:**
   - Integrate WCAG 2.0 principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) into design mockups and wireframes.
   - Review design elements (color contrasts, text size, etc.) for accessibility compliance.

5. **Development Phase:**
   - Implement text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., alt texts for images).
   - Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements.
   - Provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content.
   - Validate that forms are labeled correctly and provide instructions/error messages.

6. **Testing Phase:**
   - Develop a testing protocol to iteratively check compliance during development.
   - Use automated WCAG 2.0 compliance tools to identify basic issues.
   - Conduct manual testing, especially for keyboard accessibility and screen reader compatibility.
   - Address and document found issues and resolutions.

7. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
   - Include users with disabilities in the UAT to provide feedback.
   - Validate that all accessibility issues found during development are resolved.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain detailed documentation on the compliance status of all web pages.
   - Create a conformance statement that details the project's compliance level and areas of non-conformance.

9. **Post-launch Monitoring:**
   - Set up ongoing monitoring and maintenance plans to ensure continued compliance.
   - Plan for periodic re-evaluations of the web application against the WCAG 2.0 guidelines.

10. **Client Communication:**
    - Regularly update the client on the progress and status of WCAG compliance.
    - Provide guidance to the client on maintaining and improving accessibility post-launch.

By tracking these actions, the project manager can effectively guide the team and client to achieve and maintain WCAG 2.0 compliance for the web application.
