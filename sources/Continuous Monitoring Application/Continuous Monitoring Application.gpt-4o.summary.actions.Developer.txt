Certainly! Hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions that a Drupal developer can take to show compliance with the given government standards related to continuous monitoring and information security, as inferred from the provided document:

1. **Regular Software Updates**: Ensure Drupal core and all modules are up-to-date.
2. **Secure Configuration**: Apply required security settings and harden the server configuration for Drupal.
3. **Authentication Controls**: Implement strong password policies, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and ensure user role permissions are correctly set.
4. **Patch Management**: Regularly apply security patches for Drupal and all third-party libraries.
5. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate a vulnerability scanning tool to perform periodic checks of the Drupal site.
6. **Logging & Monitoring**: Enable and configure comprehensive logging within Drupal and set up alerts for suspicious activities.
7. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
8. **Backup Procedures**: Implement and regularly test backup and restore procedures.
9. **Error Handling**: Ensure all errors are properly caught, logged, and do not expose sensitive information.
10. **Access Controls**: Regularly review and update access controls based on the principle of least privilege.
11. **Security Review**: Perform regular security audits and reviews of the Drupal implementation.
12. **Automated Tests**: Write and run automated tests to verify that security controls are functioning as intended.
13. **Environment Isolation**: Separate development, staging, and production environments to reduce risk.
14. **Use of Secure Channels**: Ensure all data exchanges use secure channels (e.g., HTTPS).

By consistently following these actions, the Drupal developer can help ensure the web application remains compliant with relevant information security standards.
