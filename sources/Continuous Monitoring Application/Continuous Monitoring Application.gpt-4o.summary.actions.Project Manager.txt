Here is a minimal list of actions for a project manager to ensure compliance with government standards for a web application:

1. **Assess Risk**:
   - Implement a risk scoring system.
   - Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk levels.

2. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Utilize automated monitoring tools.
   - Schedule regular scans (e.g., weekly) for vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure monitoring data are updated timely and accurately.

3. **Data Accuracy and Completeness**:
   - Validate and reconcile scan data regularly.
   - Investigate and correct any inconsistencies or inaccuracies.

4. **Security Controls Implementation**:
   - Address specified security controls (e.g., patch management, antivirus updates).
   - Implement a baseline security configuration for all systems.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Establish a process for reporting and responding to security incidents.

6. **User Accountability**:
   - Assign responsibility to specific individuals for site-level security.
   - Ensure users report inaccurate or incomplete data.

7. **Configuration Management**:
   - Develop and document configuration management plans.
   - Maintain a configuration baseline for the system.

8. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Keep key security documents updated (e.g., security plan, assessment report, plan of action and milestones).
   - Notify senior managers of low security grades and require corrective actions.

9. **Stakeholder Communication**:
   - Regularly update stakeholders on the security status and any necessary actions.
   - Clarify the purpose and limitations of continuous monitoring to stakeholders.

10. **Compliance Verification**:
    - Conduct regular internal reviews and audits to ensure all standards are being met.
    - Document all compliance efforts and maintain records for audits.

This list ensures that the project is organized to meet the necessary standards while tracking and guiding tasks effectively.
