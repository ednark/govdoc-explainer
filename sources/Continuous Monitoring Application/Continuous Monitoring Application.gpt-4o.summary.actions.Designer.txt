For a web application, here is a minimal list of actions that a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design (HCD) and responsible for User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) could take to show compliance with standards, specifically focusing on the security elements highlighted in the Government Standards Document:

1. **Incorporate Security by Design Principles:**
   - Ensure the design minimizes risks such as clickjacking, SQL injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by incorporating secure coding practices.

2. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Design user interfaces that support secure login mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   - Ensure roles and permissions are clearly defined and access controls are visible in the UI.

3. **Data Privacy and User Consent:**
   - Implement clear and accessible privacy policies.
   - Design consent forms for data collection, making sure to document the userâ€™s explicit consent.

4. **Session Management:**
   - Ensure session handling (e.g., time-outs and logouts) is communicated and appropriately designed for user awareness.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Design error responses that do not reveal system information. User-friendly error messages should guide users without exposing technical details.

6. **Secure Data Input:**
   - Design input fields to validate and sanitize user inputs. Highlight requirements for secure password entry (e.g., complexity rules).

7. **Accessibility and Usability:**
   - Ensure the application follows WCAG 2.1 standards to make it accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
   - Perform usability testing to confirm ease of use does not compromise security features.

8. **User Education:**
   - Integrate educational components within the UI to inform users about secure practices and the importance of security measures applied in the application.

9. **UI for Continuous Monitoring Alerts:**
   - Design dashboards or notification systems that can display security-related alerts for continuous monitoring.

10. **Feedback and Improvement Mechanisms:**
    - Design feedback forms to collect user feedback on security features, ensuring users can easily report security issues.

11. **Adherence to Design Standards:**
    - Use standardized design frameworks and guidelines (e.g., NIST SP 800-53) to ensure compliance with recognized security requirements.

12. **Risk Communication:**
    - Clearly communicate risk levels and security statuses through intuitive UI elements like color-coded warnings and informative dashboards.

By focusing on these actions, a Designer can actively contribute to the security and compliance of a web application while ensuring a user-centered design approach.
