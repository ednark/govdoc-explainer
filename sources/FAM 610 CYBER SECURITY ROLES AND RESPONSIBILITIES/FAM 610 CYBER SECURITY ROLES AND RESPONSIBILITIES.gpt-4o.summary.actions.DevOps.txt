To ensure compliance with the provided Government Standards Document from the perspective of a DevOps technician, the following minimal actions should be taken:

1. **Access Control**:
    - **Implement Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define and enforce access levels based on user roles (e.g., user, developer, administrator).
    - **Authenticate Users**: Use secure authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    - **Authorize Access**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive and classified systems.

2. **System Security**:
    - **Apply Security Patches and Updates**: Regularly update software and systems with the latest security patches.
    - **Configure Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Ensure proper firewall configuration and IDS deployment to monitor and protect against unauthorized access.
    
3. **Data Protection**:
    - **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Ensure that all sensitive and classified data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    - **Perform Regular Backups**: Regularly backup data and ensure backups are securely stored.

4. **Compliance Checks**:
    - **Conduct Security Assessments**: Regularly perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
    - **Monitor and Log Activities**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of all system activities.

5. **Incident Response**:
    - **Establish Incident Response Plans**: Develop and maintain a documented incident response plan for cyber security incidents.
    - **Report Incidents Promptly**: Report any security breaches or incidents according to the established policies and procedures.

6. **Training and Awareness**:
    - **Provide Role-specific Training**: Ensure that all DevOps personnel receive relevant cybersecurity training, especially regarding their roles and responsibilities.
    
These actions will help build a foundational framework for cybersecurity compliance as outlined in the government standards.
