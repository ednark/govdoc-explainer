<li><p><strong>System Security</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apply Security Patches and Updates</strong>: Regularly update software and systems with the latest security patches.</li>
<li><strong>Configure Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</strong>: Ensure proper firewall configuration and IDS deployment to monitor and protect against unauthorized access.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Protection</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Encrypt Sensitive Data</strong>: Ensure that all sensitive and classified data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.</li>
<li><strong>Perform Regular Backups</strong>: Regularly backup data and ensure backups are securely stored.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance Checks</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Conduct Security Assessments</strong>: Regularly perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and Log Activities</strong>: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of all system activities.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Integrity:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Validate and sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks.</li>
<li>Use secure methods for data storage and transmission.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Patching:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Apply all relevant security patches to Drupal core and contributed modules promptly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration Management:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure configurations are stored securely and are version-controlled.</li>
<li>Use environment-specific settings to segregate development, staging, and production environments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Audit Logs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Implement logging mechanisms to record significant system events and user activities.</li>
<li>Ensure logs are stored securely and are accessible for auditing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Encryption:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.</li>
<li>Encrypt sensitive data at rest where applicable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Implement regular backup schedules and ensure backups are stored securely.</li>
<li>Test the backup and recovery procedures periodically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Session Management:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use secure session management practices, such as setting secure flags on cookies.</li>
<li>Implement session timeouts and revoke sessions after logout.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance Documentation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain documentation of security measures and compliance actions taken.</li>
<li>Generate and store compliance reports as required by relevant authorities.</li>
