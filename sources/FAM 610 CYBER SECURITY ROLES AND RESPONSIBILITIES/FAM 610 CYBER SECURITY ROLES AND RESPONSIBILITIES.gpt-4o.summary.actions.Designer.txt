Sure, here is a minimal list of actions a Designer must take to ensure compliance with the relevant government standards:

1. **Design Secure User Authentication**:
   - Implement secure login mechanisms, ensuring secure password practices and multi-factor authentication.

2. **Ensure Data Privacy**:
   - Design interfaces that minimize the collection of personal data and ensure its secure handling.
   - Incorporate clear privacy policies and consent notices.

3. **Accessible Design**:
   - Ensure the design meets accessibility standards (like WCAG) to provide equal access to all users, including those with disabilities.

4. **User Role Management**:
   - Provide clear UI elements for different authorization levels, ensuring users can only access information and features appropriate to their role.

5. **Session Management**:
   - Design mechanisms to automatically log out users after a period of inactivity to reduce risk of unauthorized access.

6. **Secure Data Entry**:
   - Use secure UI components that protect against injection attacks, such as SQL injection.

7. **User-Friendly Security Prompts**:
   - Design easy-to-understand alerts and notifications for security-related events (e.g., password changes, failed login attempts).

8. **Ergonomics and Usability**:
   - Ensure that security practices (like password resets and multi-factor authentication processes) are user-friendly and do not hinder the user experience.

9. **Secure Data Display**:
   - Avoid exposing sensitive information unnecessarily in the user interface.

10. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
    - Document design decisions related to security and ensure they are included in the user guide or relevant documentation for the application.

These actions will help integrate security considerations into the user experience and interface design process, aligning the final web application with the required standards.
