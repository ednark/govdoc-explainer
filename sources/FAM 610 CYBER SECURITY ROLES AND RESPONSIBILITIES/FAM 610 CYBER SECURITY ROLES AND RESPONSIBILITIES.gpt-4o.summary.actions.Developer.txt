To ensure compliance with the government standards from the perspective of a developer specializing in Drupal, you should focus on implementing the following key actions:

1. **Access Control:**
   - Ensure proper user authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.
   - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different user levels.

2. **Data Integrity:**
   - Validate and sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks.
   - Use secure methods for data storage and transmission.

3. **Security Patching:**
   - Apply all relevant security patches to Drupal core and contributed modules promptly.

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - Ensure configurations are stored securely and are version-controlled.
   - Use environment-specific settings to segregate development, staging, and production environments.

5. **Audit Logs:**
   - Implement logging mechanisms to record significant system events and user activities.
   - Ensure logs are stored securely and are accessible for auditing.

6. **Encryption:**
   - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest where applicable.

7. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Implement regular backup schedules and ensure backups are stored securely.
   - Test the backup and recovery procedures periodically.

8. **Session Management:**
   - Use secure session management practices, such as setting secure flags on cookies.
   - Implement session timeouts and revoke sessions after logout.

9. **Compliance Documentation:**
   - Maintain documentation of security measures and compliance actions taken.
   - Generate and store compliance reports as required by relevant authorities.

10. **Vulnerability Testing:**
    - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
    - Address identified vulnerabilities promptly.

By following these steps, a developer can ensure that the web application aligns with the necessary government cyber security standards and mitigates key security risks.
