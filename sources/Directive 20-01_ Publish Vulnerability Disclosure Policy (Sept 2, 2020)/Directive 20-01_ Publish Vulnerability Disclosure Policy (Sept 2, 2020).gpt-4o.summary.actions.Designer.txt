As a designer specializing in Human Centered Design, here are the minimal actions you should take to show compliance with the relevant portions of the Government Standards Document, focusing on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI):

1. **Include Clear Reporting Pathways:**
   - Design a section on the project’s main webpage for "Vulnerability Disclosure."
   - Ensure this section is easily accessible from the homepage.

2. **Ensuring Plain Language:**
   - Write all instructions and copy related to vulnerability reporting in plain, simple language.
   - Avoid legalese and technical jargon to make the content more user-friendly.

3. **Accessible Contact Information:**
   - Provide a dedicated email address (e.g., security@agency.gov) for reporting vulnerabilities. 
   - Ensure this email is prominently displayed and accessible.

4. **Design for Anonymity:**
   - Include options for anonymous submissions in the reporting forms or web pages.
   - Clearly state that users can report vulnerabilities without providing personal information.

5. **Feedback and Transparency:**
   - Design a feedback process, where reporters can receive acknowledgments and updates on their reports.
   - Include a static text section outlining the actions taken during the remediation process.

6. **Scope and Testing Information:**
   - Create a page or section clearly listing which systems are in scope for vulnerability testing.
   - Outline which types of testing are allowed and specifically state prohibited activities.

7. **Warm, Encouraging Tone:**
   - Use friendly and inviting language on all forms and pages related to vulnerability reporting.
   - Convey the agency’s commitment to security and appreciation for external help.

8. **Security Banners:**
   - Ensure system use notifications (pop-ups or banners) inform users about the vulnerability disclosure policy.
   - Include links to the policy and reporting procedures in these notifications.

9. **Web Form Design:**
   - Design a structured web form for submitting vulnerability reports.
   - Make key fields mandatory (e.g., description of vulnerability, location, etc.) but avoid requiring sensitive personal information.

10. **Accessibility Compliance:**
    - Ensure all elements of the reporting interface meet accessibility standards (e.g., ADA compliance).
    - Use high contrast text, keyboard navigable elements, and screen reader-friendly tags.

By implementing these actions, you will ensure that your web application’s UX and UI design supports compliance with the Government Standards Document, specifically the requirements for a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
