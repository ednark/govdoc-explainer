For a Drupal developer working on backend business logic for a web application, the following list of actions will help ensure compliance with the government standards regarding a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP):

1. **Add Security Contact Information**
   - Update security contact information at the .gov registrar with a monitored email address (e.g., security@agency.gov).

2. **Implement VDP Page**
   - Create and publish a publicly accessible VDP page at `/vulnerability-disclosure-policy` on the agency's primary .gov website.

3. **Scope of Systems**
   - Ensure at least one internet-accessible production system/service is included in the VDP scope at the time of publication.

4. **Allowed Testing Types**
   - Define the authorized types of security testing and any prohibited actions, ensuring this information is detailed in the VDP.

5. **Report Submission Process**
   - Set up a process for submitting vulnerability reports via a web form or specified email address.
   - Include a request for all necessary information to analyze the vulnerability (e.g., description, location, potential impact, technical details).

6. **Legal Assurance Statement**
   - Add a statement in the VDP that commits not to recommend or pursue legal action against anyone making a good faith effort to follow the policy.

7. **Acknowledgement and Transparency**
   - Incorporate a statement setting expectations for acknowledging receipt of reports and pledge to be transparent about remediation steps.

8. **Metric Reporting**
   - Ensure any vulnerability disclosure involves tracking and reporting metrics such as the number of reports, their validity, and median response times.

9. **Support Procedures**
   - Develop internal handling procedures aligned with the VDP, ensuring they cover tracking, triaging, prioritizing, and resolving vulnerability reports.

10. **Expand VDP Scope**
    - Plan to gradually expand the VDP scope to include all internet-accessible systems and services within two years.

11. **Initial Setup and Updates**
    - Regularly update the VDP to reflect new systems/services and ensure all newly launched systems are included in the VDP scope.

By following these steps, a developer can ensure the technical implementation aligns with the required standards for vulnerability disclosure while safeguarding the systems and services offered to the public.
