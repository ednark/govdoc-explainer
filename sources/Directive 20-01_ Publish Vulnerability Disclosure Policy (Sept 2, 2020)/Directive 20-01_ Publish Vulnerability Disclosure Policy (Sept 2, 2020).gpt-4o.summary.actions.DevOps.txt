Absolutely, here is a concise and practical list of actions for a DevOps technician to show compliance with the government standards for a web application:

1. **Set Up a Security Contact Email:**
   - Register and regularly monitor a security contact email address (e.g., security@yourdomain.gov) for each .gov domain.
   
2. **Define Security Contact:**
   - Ensure the "Organization" field in the .gov registrar correctly identifies the responsible agency component for the domain.

3. **Publish a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP):**
   - Publish a VDP as a public web page at the "/vulnerability-disclosure-policy" path of the applicationâ€™s primary .gov website. This must include all required elements (authorized tests, submission methods, legal protections, etc.).

4. **Regularly Update Systems In Scope:**
   - Ensure that all newly launched internet-accessible systems or services are included in the VDP scope immediately upon launch.

5. **Expand Scope Periodically:**
   - Extend the VDP scope by at least one internet-accessible system or service every 90 days until all systems are included.

6. **Develop Handling Procedures:**
   - Create or update procedures for tracking and resolving vulnerability reports, including communication with reporters and stakeholders.

7. **Set Up Reporting Mechanisms:**
   - Implement web forms or dedicated web applications (secured via HTTPS) for vulnerability submissions.
   - Ensure alternative reporting methods (e.g., email) are also functional and monitored.

8. **Regular Communication and Updates:**
   - Define and adhere to target timelines for acknowledging, assessing, and resolving reported vulnerabilities.
   - Maintain transparent communication with reporters about the steps taken during the remediation process.

9. **Coordinate Internally:**
   - Streamline internal coordination among teams to remediate vulnerabilities effectively and promptly.

10. **Ensure Data Handling and Privacy:**
    - Avoid requiring personally identifiable information (PII) in the VDP submissions unless voluntarily provided by the reporter.

11. **Monitor and Report Metrics:**
    - Track and report metrics to CISA as required, including the number of reports, valid vulnerabilities, resolution times, and compliance with timelines.

By ensuring these minimal actions are taken, you will be aligning your infrastructure and processes with the government standards required for your web application.
