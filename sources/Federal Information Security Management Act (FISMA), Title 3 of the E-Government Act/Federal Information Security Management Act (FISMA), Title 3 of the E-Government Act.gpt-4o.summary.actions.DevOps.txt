For a DevOps technician ensuring compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) standards for a web application project, the following actions should be taken:

1. **Maintain an Inventory of Information Systems**:
   - Document and maintain an inventory of all servers, networking devices, and software components.

2. **Categorize Systems Based on Risk**:
   - Use FIPS 199 standards to categorize information and systems based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.

3. **Implement Security Controls**:
   - Apply security controls from NIST SP 800-53 to meet minimum security requirements.
   - Tailor the controls to fit the organizationâ€™s mission and operational environment.

4. **Develop and Maintain a System Security Plan (SSP)**:
   - Create and update an SSP for documenting implemented security controls and system boundaries.

5. **Conduct Risk Assessments**:
   - Regularly assess potential threats and vulnerabilities, calculate risks, and determine the need for additional controls.

6. **Establish Configuration Management**:
   - Implement configuration management to ensure consistent and secure deployment of infrastructure components.
   - Maintain baselines and control changes to system configurations.

7. **Monitor Security Controls Continuously**:
   - Continuously monitor and assess the effectiveness of security controls.
   - Perform periodic and event-driven reviews and updates to security controls.

8. **Implement Incident Response Mechanisms**:
   - Set up and maintain incident response procedures to detect, report, and remediate security incidents.
   - Ensure there are mechanisms for logging and analyzing security events.

9. **Ensure Continuous Compliance**:
   - Regularly review and update compliance documentation to reflect current infrastructure and control measures.
   - Re-evaluate security posture with any significant changes to the system.

10. **Coordinate with System Owners**:
    - Work with system owners to review, approve, and document changes impacting system security.
    - Ensure that appropriate personnel have the needed access and training for compliance activities.

By focusing on these actions, a DevOps technician can help ensure that the infrastructure supporting the web application aligns with FISMA requirements.
