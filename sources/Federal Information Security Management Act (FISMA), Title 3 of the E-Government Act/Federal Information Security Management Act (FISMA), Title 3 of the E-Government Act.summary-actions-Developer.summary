To demonstrate compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) when working on a Drupal web application project as a developer, you should focus on the following core actions:

1. **Security Controls Implementation**: Refer to NIST Special Publication 800-53 for recommended security controls tailored to the specific categorization of your Drupal application. Implement these controls directly or ensure appropriate configurations in Drupal to match these requirements.

2. **System Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive and accurate documentation including details of the Drupal application architecture, security controls implemented, and any custom code or modules used. The documentation should align with the standards set by NIST SP 800-18, Revision 1, which provides a guide for developing security plans for federal information systems.

3. **Risk Assessment and Management**: Perform regular risk assessments as per guidelines in NIST SP 800-53A and SP 800-37, identifying potential vulnerabilities in your Drupal application and assessing their impact and likelihood. The assessments will guide the implementation of additional security controls or changes to existing ones.

4. **Security Categorization**: Follow FIPS 199 to categorize your Drupal application based on the potential impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Ensure each information type within the application is categorized correctly, influencing the selection of security controls.

5. **Configuration Management**: Regularly update and patch Drupal and its modules to protect against known vulnerabilities. Utilize tools for configuration management to ensure consistent settings across development, testing, and production environments.

6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish a continuous monitoring strategy that includes regular security scans, audit log reviews, and performance monitoring to detect and respond to threats in real time.

7. **System Security Plan**: Develop a comprehensive system security plan for your Drupal application that details the security measures in place and how they are implemented. Regularly update the plan to reflect any changes to the system or its operational environment.

8. **Security Certification and Accreditation**: Prepare for and conduct security accreditation processes as defined in NIST SP 800-37, which involves documenting the security posture of your application and obtaining formal approval to operate.

9. **Training and Awareness**: Ensure that all team members are aware of the security requirements and their responsibilities in maintaining the security and compliance of the Drupal application. Provide regular training on security best practices and updates on federal requirements.

By systematically addressing these areas, you will align your Drupal application development and deployment processes with FISMA standards, ensuring that the system is secure and compliant with federal regulations.
