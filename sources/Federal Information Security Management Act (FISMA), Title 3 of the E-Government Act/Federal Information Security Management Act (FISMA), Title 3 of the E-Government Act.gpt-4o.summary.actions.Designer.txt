To ensure compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) from a Human-Centered Design (HCD) perspective, a Designer responsible for User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) should address the following actions:

1. **Understand User Data Sensitivity**:
   - Identify and categorize data sensitivity (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI)).

2. **Accessible Security Features**:
   - Design intuitive login and authentication processes.
   - Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is user-friendly.

3. **Data Protection Interface**:
   - Use clear and simple language to inform users about how their data is protected.
   - Design consent and privacy settings accessible and comprehensible.

4. **Error Handling and Reporting**:
   - Design informative and actionable error messages for security-related issues.
   - Provide users with clear steps on how to report security incidents or suspicious activity.

5. **Consistent Security Messaging Across UI**:
   - Ensure consistent security notifications and messages are present throughout the application.

6. **Secure Data Input and Storage**:
   - Design forms and data input fields to minimize the risk of unauthorized data entry or leakage.
   - Ensure encryption is indicated clearly to users during sensitive data transactions.

7. **User Training and Awareness**:
   - Include in-app tutorials or help sections on security practices.
   - Design interfaces that encourage users to adopt secure behaviors.

8. **Continuous Feedback Loop**:
   - Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to address and resolve security concerns in the interface.

By addressing these HCD-centric actions, the Designer can help ensure the web application aligns with FISMA standards while maintaining a secure and user-friendly experience.
