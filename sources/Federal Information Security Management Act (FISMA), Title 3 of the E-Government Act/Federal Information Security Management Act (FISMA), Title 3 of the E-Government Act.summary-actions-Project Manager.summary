To ensure compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) for a web application project, as a project manager you should consider the following essential actions:

1. **Inventory of Information Systems**: Document all components and interfaces of the web application, including any connections to external systems or networks.

2. **Categorize Information and Systems**: Assess and classify the web application and its data based on security categories using FIPS 199 and NIST SP 800-60 guidelines. This will help determine the security requirements based on the levels of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

3. **Select Security Controls**: Utilize NIST SP 800-53 to select appropriate security controls tailored to the categorized risk level. Ensure these controls address management, operational, and technical safeguards.

4. **Implement Security Controls**: Integrate the selected security controls during the development phase of the web application. This includes cryptographic protections, access controls, and incident response mechanisms.

5. **Develop a System Security Plan**: Create a detailed security plan for the web application as per NIST SP 800-18, documenting the security requirements, controls in place, roles and responsibilities, and operational procedures.

6. **Conduct Risk Assessments**: Regularly assess risks to the web application by identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities. Update security controls based on the findings to mitigate identified risks.

7. **Certification and Accreditation Process**: Engage in a formal security certification process (NIST SP 800-37) where the implemented security measures are evaluated to ensure they are functioning correctly and meet the desired security standards.

8. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish procedures for ongoing monitoring of the web application's security posture. This includes regular updates to the system security plan, reassessing security controls, and addressing new security vulnerabilities.

9. **Achieve Security Accreditation**: Obtain formal accreditation from a senior agency official, confirming the web applicationâ€™s compliance with federal security requirements and authorizing its operation.

10. **Document Compliance and Reporting**: Prepare and maintain records of all compliance activities, including security plan updates, risk assessment results, and accreditation documents to demonstrate adherence to FISMA regulations.

These actions will guide you in structuring your project to meet FISMA requirements, improve the web application's security, and ensure that the necessary documentation and processes are in place for a successful compliance audit.
