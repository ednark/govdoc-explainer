In practical terms for maintaining compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) for a web application, a project manager needs to ensure the following actions:

1. **Inventory Information Systems**  
   - Maintain an inventory of all major information systems, including interfaces.

2. **Categorize Information Systems**  
   - Classify systems and data based on risk levels using FIPS 199 and NIST SP 800-60 as guides.

3. **Apply Security Controls**  
   - Implement baseline security controls from NIST SP 800-53 and document these controls in the System Security Plan.

4. **Perform Risk Assessment**  
   - Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities and determine appropriate risk mitigation measures.

5. **Develop a System Security Plan**  
   - Create and maintain a System Security Plan according to the guidelines in NIST SP 800-18.

6. **Certification and Accreditation**  
   - Ensure systems undergo a certification process to validate security controls and receive official accreditation for operation following NIST SP 800-37.

7. **Continuous Monitoring**  
   - Establish a process for ongoing monitoring of security controls to identify and rectify any changes or vulnerabilities.

8. **Corrective Action Plans**  
   - Develop, implement, and track corrective action plans for any identified deficiencies in security controls.

9. **Annual Review and Reporting**  
   - Conduct annual reviews of the information security program and report results to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

By tracking and organizing these key actions, a project manager can guide the web application project towards compliance with FISMA standards, ensuring all necessary security measures are in place and monitored continually.
