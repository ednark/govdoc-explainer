### Document Summary: Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

#### Security:
1. **FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002)**: Mandates federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an information security program.
   - **NIST Standards and Guidelines**: As directed by FISMA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, and techniques for adequate security of agency operations and assets, excluding national security systems.
   - **FIPS 199**: Defines security categorization of federal information and information systems.
   - **FIPS 200**: Establishes minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems.
   - **NIST SP 800-53**: Recommends security controls and assurance requirements for federal information systems.
   - **Security Certification and Accreditation**: Described in NIST SP 800-37, involves a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system.

#### Accessibility, User Experience:
These topics are not directly covered in the provided standards document. However, implementing security controls from NIST SP 800-53 could indirectly improve the user experience by ensuring system reliability and data integrity.

#### Compliance:
- **Annual Reviews and Reporting**: FISMA requires annual reviews of the agency's information security program by agency officials, CIOs, and IGs, with results reported to the Office of Management and Budget.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ensures ongoing assessment and necessary updates to security controls and documentation as outlined in NIST standards.

### Condensed Summary:
- **Security**: FISIA mandates comprehensive information security programs in federal agencies, underpinned by NIST standards (FIPS 199, FIPS 200, SP 800-53, SP 800-37) focusing on categorization, minimum security requirements, recommended security controls, and a formal certification process.
- **Compliance**: Emphasizes regular reviews, reporting to OMB, and continuous monitoring to maintain and update security controls as per federal requirements. 

**Note**: Information on accessibility and user experience improvements via security measures are implicit and dependent on the effective execution of outlined security controls.
