As a designer focused on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) for a web application within the context of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) and its updated standards, it's crucial to integrate specific considerations to meet compliance. Here’s a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance from a UX/UI development standpoint:

1. **Security Controls Integration**:
   - Integrate security features into the design of the user interface visibly when appropriate. For example, placing multi-factor authentication processes seamlessly within the login module. Ensure all security alerts and user notifications concerning security are clear and understandable to the user.

2. **Data Protection Awareness**:
   - Design user interfaces in such a way that they educate users on the importance of data protection. This can involve tooltips, information icons, or dedicated sections that briefly describe security measures undertaken to protect their data.

3. **User Access Design**:
   - Safeguard sensitive information by designing clear user roles and access levels within the application. UI elements should dynamically adapt based on the user’s role and permissions, ensuring users only interact with data and actions they’re authorized for.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Create user-friendly error messages that do not disclose sensitive information yet guide users effectively. Errors should help users understand what went wrong and suggest next steps without revealing technical details that could aid potential security threats.

5. **Compliance with Security Configurations**:
   - Adhere to prescribed security configurations and standards for federal information systems, like those defined in FISMA supports, ensuring the UI doesn’t allow users to configure settings in a way that would make the system vulnerable.

6. **System Security Plan Inclusion**:
   - UI/UX designs should allow for displaying or reporting system security plans when needed, especially in settings or administrative interfaces where understanding the system's security setup is necessary. 

7, **Security Feedback Incorporation**:
   - Implement mechanisms for collecting user feedback on security concerns. Design interfaces for users to easily report security issues or suspicious activities, helping continually evolve security measures based on user interactions.

8. **Regular Updates and Guidelines**:
   - Ensure design guidelines and templates adhere to the latest security standards and are updated in line with new regulatory requirements. This includes updates to compliance documentation that reflects any changes in the UX/UI that may affect security.

9. **Design for Security Monitoring**:
   - Facilitate the continuous monitoring requirements of FISMA by designing interfaces in dashboards that provide security performance metrics or status reports to administrators or compliance officers.

By incorporating these design-centric actions, the UX/UI approach not only enhances the user experience but also upholds and integrates the key security and compliance measures necessary under FISA standards. This aspect of design demonstrates an understanding that compliance is not just about checking boxes but ensuring every layer of the application, down to how users interact with it, is secure and operates within the required guidelines.
