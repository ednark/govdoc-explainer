1. **Inventory of Information Systems**: Document all major information systems related to the web application, including any interfaces with other systems.

2. **Categorization of Information and Systems**: Determine and document the risk level of the application and its data using FIPS 199 and other relevant standards to understand security requirements.

3. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct a thorough evaluation of potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to the web application, gauge the impact and likelihood of exploitation, and decide on mitigation strategies.

4. **Implement Security Controls**: Based on the categorization and risk assessment, apply appropriate security controls from NIST SP 800-53. This may include authentication mechanisms, encryption, and access controls.

5. **System Security Plan**: Develop and maintain a detailed security plan describing the security requirements and controls implemented for the web application. This plan should be regularly reviewed and updated.

6. **Certification and Accreditation**: Prepare the web application for security certification and accreditation. Ensure it meets the minimum baseline of security as per FISMA requirements. 

7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish procedures for ongoing assessment of the security controls in place. This should include updating security measures and practices based on new threats and vulnerabilities and reevaluating the risks.

8. **Incident Response and Recovery**: Create and regularly update plans for responding to security incidents and recovering from them, ensuring minimal impact and quick restoration of services.

9. **Documentation and Reporting**: Maintain proper documentation of compliance efforts and security practices. Regularly prepare reports for internal audits and reviews, showing compliance with FISMA.

By adhering to these nine succinct steps, the project aligns with the key FISMA requirements, ensuring the security and resilience of the web application against various cyber threats.
