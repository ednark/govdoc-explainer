Sure, here's a concise list of actions that a developer specializing in Drupal can take to ensure that their web application is compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA):

1. **Implement Secure Authentication**:
   - Enforce strong password policies.
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

2. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**:
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
   - Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Define and enforce role-based access controls.
   - Regularly review and update access permissions.

4. **Install Security Modules**:
   - Use security-focused Drupal modules (e.g., Security Kit, Login Security).
   - Keep all modules and Drupal core up to date.

5. **Conduct Regular Security Audits**:
   - Perform vulnerability scans.
   - Conduct code reviews and penetration testing.

6. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Enable detailed logging for all critical actions.
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activities.

7. **Data Backup and Recovery**:
   - Set up automated backups.
   - Test backups to ensure data can be restored.

8. **Secure Configuration**:
   - Follow best practices for securing the Drupal configuration.
   - Disable unnecessary services and modules.

9. **Input Validation and Sanitation**:
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, etc.
   - Use Drupal's built-in API functions for input processing.

10. **Prepare System Security Plan (SSP)**:
    - Document the security controls and how they are implemented.
    - Ensure that the System Security Plan is reviewed and updated periodically.

By following these actions, a Drupal developer can ensure that their web application adheres to the relevant portions of the FISMA standards.
