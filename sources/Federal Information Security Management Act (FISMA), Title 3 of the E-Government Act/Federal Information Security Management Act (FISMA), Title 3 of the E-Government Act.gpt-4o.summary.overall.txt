1. **Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements:**
   - **NIST Standards:** Agency-wide mandatory information security standards.
   - **Annual Reviews:** Conducted by agency program officials, CIOs, and IGs.
   - **Security Categories:** Define levels of risk for information and systems (FIPS 199).
   - **Security Controls:** Minimum security requirements (FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-53).
   - **Risk Assessment:** Defines vulnerabilities and threats.
   - **System Security Plan:** Details security controls and implementation plans (NIST SP 800-18).
   - **Certification & Accreditation:** Review of security controls (NIST SP 800-37).
   - **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing security controls assessments and updates.

2. **Sections Focused on Security:**
   - **Security Controls (NIST SP 800-53):** Essential measures for protecting information systems.
   - **Certification & Accreditation (NIST SP 800-37):** Validation of security effectiveness.
   - **Continuous Monitoring:** Regular updates and assessments of security status.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Identifying and mitigating threats and vulnerabilities.

3. **Sections Focused on Accessibility:**
   - **Inventory of Information Systems:** Keeping track of system interfaces and controls (NIST SP 800-18).
   - **Security Categories (FIPS 199):** Defining impact levels to support system integrity and accessibility.
   - **System Security Plan (NIST SP 800-18):** Documentation to ensure systems' operational security and accessibility.

4. **Sections Focused on User Experience:**
   - **System Security Plan (NIST SP 800-18):** Considers user requirements and operational constraints.
   - **Continuous Monitoring:** Ensure security does not impede user functionality.

5. **Sections Focused on Compliance:**
   - **NIST Guidelines:** Follow the steps and standards for compliance.
   - **Annual Reviews:** Ensure ongoing compliance with FISMA.
   - **OMB Reporting:** Annual compliance reporting to the Office of Management and Budget.
   - **Security Controls Documentation:** Record of all compliance measures and controls implemented.
