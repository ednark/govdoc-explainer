To ensure your web application project complies with the government standards for obtaining and managing a `.gov` domain, here’s a concise checklist specifically tailored for a developer implementing a site with Drupal:

1. **Domain Eligibility Verification**: Confirm that the web application is eligible for a `.gov` domain as per government standards. This involves ensuring that it’s an official government entity at any level (city, county, or other governmental divisions).

2. **Domain Availability Search**: Before proceeding, check whether the desired `.gov` domain is available. Utilize the official channels or services provided by `.gov` to verify availability.

3. **Domain Registration Process**: Register the chosen `.gov` domain following the specified procedures. This might involve coordinating with the business team to provide necessary documents and information proving government entity status.

4. **Implement Trust and Security Features**: Given the trust associated with `.gov` domains, implement HTTPS to secure the website. Ensure that security best practices are followed during the development process, including regular updates and patches for Drupal and its modules.

5. **Maintain Compliance with `.gov` Requirements**: Keep the domain and the site compliant with any ongoing requirements set forth by the `.gov` authorities, which might include specific configurations or reporting obligations.

6. **Domain Management**: Set up processes for ongoing domain management, including renewals, updates, and compliance checks. Ensure that administrative contact information is always current and that roles are clearly defined for managing the domain.

7. **Documentation and Support**: Document all steps taken for compliance and ensure that there is sufficient support for navigating `.gov` policies. This may include creating manuals or guides specifically for team members involved in maintaining the `.gov` domain.

By following this checklist, you can demonstrate adherence to the required standards while leveraging Drupal capabilities to build and maintain a secure and compliant government web application.
