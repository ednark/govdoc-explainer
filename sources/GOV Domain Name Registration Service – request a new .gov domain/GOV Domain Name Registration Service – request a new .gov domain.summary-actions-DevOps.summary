To ensure compliance with government standards for hosting web applications on a .gov domain, a DevOps technician should take the following actions:

1. **Domain Acquisition:** Initiate the process to acquire a .gov domain by checking the availability of the desired domain name and ensuring it aligns with the organization and meets government requirements.

2. **Eligibility Verification:** Confirm that the entity seeking the .gov domain is an eligible government entity at any level (city, county, etc.).

3. **Domain Management Setup:** Set up mechanisms for managing the .gov domain, including renewal alerts and administrative contact updates.

4. **Secure Hosting Configuration:** Implement a secure hosting environment that complies with government security standards, including data encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

5. **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensure that the web application meets all applicable accessibility standards to serve all segments of the public effectively.

6. **Continuous Monitoring & Maintenance:** Regularly monitor the infrastructure for performance and security issues and apply timely updates and patches.

7. **Documentation and Compliance Reporting:** Maintain thorough documentation of all processes, including domain management, security measures, and compliance efforts, for auditing and reporting purposes. 

By following these summarized steps, a DevOps technician can adequately prepare and manage a web application's infrastructure to comply with the necessary government standards related to .gov domains.
