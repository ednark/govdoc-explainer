As a Designer focusing on Human Centered Design and responsible for UX/UI in governmental web applications, here is a minimal list of actions to take to comply with the provided standards:

1. **Choose the Right Domain:**
   Ensure that the web application makes use of a .gov domain to clearly signal to users that they are accessing an official government site. This involves checking for domain availability and ensuring the chosen domain name appropriately reflects the organization's function and adheres to any specific requirements outlined for .gov domains.

2. **Ensure Trust and Credibility:**
   Design the interface in a way that promotes trust and credibility. Utilize the .gov domain effectively in your design elements to highlight the official status of the website. This could be integrated subtly in the footer or more prominently near the logo or header.

3. **Eligibility Check:**
   Design processes or user flows must incorporate an eligibility check for users seeking to interact with the site in a capacity that might require credentials or special access, keeping in line with the .gov criteria.

4. **User-Friendly Design:**
   Focus on a clean, efficient, and accessible design to facilitate ease of use, especially considering the diverse user base typical of government websites. This should include clear navigation, readable fonts, and a responsive layout that adapts to various devices and screen sizes.

5. **Host Credible and Official Information:**
   Ensure all content hosted on the site is official and trustworthy. Design content layouts that prioritize critical information and make it easily accessible to the public.

6. **Accessibility and Inclusivity:**
   Follow best practices to make the website accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Implement guidelines from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the design meets necessary standards of accessibility.

By adhering to these steps, the design will not only comply with government standards but also provide an effective and engaging user experience.
