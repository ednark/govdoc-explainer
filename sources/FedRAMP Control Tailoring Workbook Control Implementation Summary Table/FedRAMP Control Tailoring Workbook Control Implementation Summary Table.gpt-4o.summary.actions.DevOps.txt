For a DevOps technician tasked with ensuring compliance with government standards for a web application, the following minimal list of actions should be taken:

1. **Implement Security Controls:**
   - Deploy host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) on all servers.
   - Ensure Domain Name System (DNS) services are secure and reliable.
   - Set up multi-factor authentication for all admin and user accounts.

2. **Configuration Management:**
   - Maintain detailed configuration scripts (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to consistently deploy secure settings.
   - Implement version control for all infrastructure code to track changes and maintain consistency.

3. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Set up continuous monitoring for all servers and applications.
   - Implement centralized logging services to collect and store logs for audit and review.
   - Define and monitor key security events and alerts.

4. **Access Controls:**
   - Restrict administrative access to essential personnel only.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) configurations to regulate permissions.
   - Regularly review and update access rights.

5. **Network Security:**
   - Deploy firewalls and security groups to limit and segment traffic between services.
   - Use encryption for data both in-transit (e.g., HTTPS) and at-rest.

6. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
   - Implement automated backup processes for critical data and system configurations.
   - Test disaster recovery procedures regularly to ensure they are effective.

7. **Environment Segmentation:**
   - Separate production, staging, and development environments to limit access and potential exposure.

8. **Compliance Documentation:**
   - Keep detailed documentation of implemented security controls and configurations.
   - Update compliance documentation as part of continuous monitoring activities.

9. **Patch Management:**
   - Implement automated patch management to ensure systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

10. **Regular Audits:**
    - Conduct regular internal audits to ensure compliance with FedRAMP standards.
    - Prepare for third-party assessments by reviewing compliance readiness.

These actions address major security and compliance requirements relevant to FedRAMP standards in a practical and executable manner by a DevOps technician.
