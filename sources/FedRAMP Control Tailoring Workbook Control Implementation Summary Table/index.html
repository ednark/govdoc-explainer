                        <div class="accordion-content"><p>For a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design and responsible for the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) of a web application, here is a minimal list of actions to show compliance with government standards:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility Compliance</strong>: Ensure that the application meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standards for accessibility, including providing text alternatives for non-text content, creating content that can be presented in different ways, and making content easier to see and hear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Authentication Design</strong>: Design interfaces that support secure user authentication mechanisms, including multifactor authentication (if required), in accordance with the security guidelines indicated in the CRM Worksheet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Roles and Permissions</strong>: Clearly design user interfaces to handle role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring different user roles have access to the appropriate features and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Privacy and Consent</strong>: Implement interfaces that collect user consent for data processing and provide clear communication on data usage, storage, and sharing according to government privacy policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness</strong>: Include UI elements that make users aware of security features and the importance of maintaining secure practices (e.g., reminders about strong passwords).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance with Branding Standards</strong>: Ensure that all UI elements adhere to specified branding standards and guidelines provided by the government or the contracting agency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usability Testing</strong>: Conduct usability testing sessions with representative users to ensure that the interfaces are intuitive and align with government expectations for ease of use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Document Changes and Updates</strong>: Keep a detailed revision history of all design changes, updates, and iterations to demonstrate a clear protocol for maintaining and improving the interface in compliance with standards.</p></li>
