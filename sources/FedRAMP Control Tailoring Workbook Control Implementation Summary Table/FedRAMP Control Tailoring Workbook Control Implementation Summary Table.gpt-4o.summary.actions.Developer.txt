Certainly! Here's a minimal list of actions that a Drupal developer should take to ensure compliance with government standards based on the FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP) Appendix J:

1. **Implement Access Controls**
   - Configure role-based access controls within Drupal.
   - Set up multifactor authentication for all admin users.

2. **Data Encryption**
   - Enable and enforce HTTPs for all website communications.
   - Utilize Drupal modules to ensure encrypted storage of sensitive data (e.g., Encrypt, Key modules).

3. **Audit and Logging**
   - Enable logging for user activities and system events.
   - Configure log retention policies in alignment with the standards.

7. **Monitoring and Incident Response**
   - Enable security alerts for unusual activities or potential breaches.
   - Prepare and document an incident response plan.

8. **User Management**

10. **Documentation and Compliance**
   - Document all security controls and configurations.
   - Maintain compliance records and updates based on FedRAMP guidelines.

By following these actions, a Drupal developer can help ensure that the web application complies with government standards related to cybersecurity and data protection.
