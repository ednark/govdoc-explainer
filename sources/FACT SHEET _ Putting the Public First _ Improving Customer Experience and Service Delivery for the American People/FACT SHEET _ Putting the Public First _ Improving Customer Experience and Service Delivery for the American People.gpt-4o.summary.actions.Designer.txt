   - Develop personas and user journey maps to guide design decisions.
   
2. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure the application is compliant with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
   - Implement accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
   
3. **Usability Testing**:
   - Perform usability testing with real users to gather feedback and identify areas of improvement.
   - Iterate on design based on feedback received during testing sessions.

4. **Streamlined Navigation**:
   - Design intuitive and streamlined navigation to reduce complexity.
   - Ensure key services and information are accessible within 1-3 clicks/taps from the homepage.

5. **Responsive Design**:

   - Implement a mobile-first approach to cater to a wide range of users.

6. **Consistent Branding**:
   - Apply consistent branding elements that align with government standards.
   - Use clear and consistent labeling and terminology for all features and sections.

7. **Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Incorporate mechanisms for users to provide feedback easily.
   - Design user interfaces that collect feedback during critical interactions.

8. **Clear Communication**:
   - Use plain language and avoid jargon to make information easy to understand.
   - Provide real-time status updates and notifications where applicable.

9. **Privacy and Security**:
   - Incorporate privacy-by-design principles throughout the user interface.
   - Ensure clear communication of privacy policies and data handling practices.

10. **Personalization and Customization**:
    - Provide personalized tools and options for users, tailored to their specific needs (e.g., options for different user roles or preferences).
