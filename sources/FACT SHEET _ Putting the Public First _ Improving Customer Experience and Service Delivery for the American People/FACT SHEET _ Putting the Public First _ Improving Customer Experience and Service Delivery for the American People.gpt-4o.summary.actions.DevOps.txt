Sure, here are the key actions from the perspective of a DevOps technician to ensure compliance with the government standards document:

1. **Implement Secure Online Services:**
   - Ensure all user interactions and data exchanges with the application are encrypted (TLS/SSL).
   - Use secure, modern authentication mechanisms (e.g., Login.gov integration for VA services).

2. **Enhance System Availability and Reliability:**
   - Deploy applications across multiple availability zones or regions for redundancy and high availability.
   - Implement automated monitoring and alerting for system uptime and performance.

3. **Simplify User Access:**
   - Develop single sign-on (SSO) systems to integrate access across multiple federal services.

4. **Automate Infrastructure Management:**
   - Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools (like Terraform or CloudFormation) to automate infrastructure provisioning and changes.
   - Maintain a CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent and reliable application deployments.

5. **Ensure Scalability:**
   - Design the infrastructure to automatically scale up or down based on demand (using auto-scaling groups).
   - Utilize load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across servers.

6. **Data Privacy and Compliance:**
   - Regularly audit and update privacy and data handling policies.
   - Ensure data storage solutions comply with federal data security requirements.

7. **Disaster Recovery and Backup:**
   - Implement automated backup procedures for all databases and critical data.
   - Establish a disaster recovery plan and ensure regular testing of recovery processes.

8. **Feedback and Performance Metrics:**
   - Implement logging and analytics tools to collect user feedback and performance metrics.
   - Report performance data and user feedback publicly as required.

9. **Accessible and User-Friendly Interfaces:**
   - Ensure web applications are compliant with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
   - Test and optimize the user experience for simplicity and ease of use.

10. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
   - Ensure timely application of security patches and updates.

These actions help align the application infrastructure to improve customer experience, enhance security, and ensure a reliable, user-centered service delivery as directed by the Executive Order.
