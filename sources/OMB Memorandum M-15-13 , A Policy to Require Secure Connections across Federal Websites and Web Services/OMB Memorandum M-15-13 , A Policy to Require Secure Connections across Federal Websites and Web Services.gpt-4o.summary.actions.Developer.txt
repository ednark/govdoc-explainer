For a Developer implementing backend business logic in Drupal to ensure compliance with the HTTPS-only policy, here is a minimal list of actions that needs to be taken:

1. **Enable HTTPS**:
   - Ensure the Drupal site is configured to use HTTPS.

2. **Obtain and Install SSL Certificate**:
   - Acquire a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   - Install the SSL certificate on the web server hosting the Drupal site.

3. **Configure HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**:
   - Update server settings to include the HSTS header with a `max-age` of at least one year.

4. **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**:
   - Set up server rules to force all HTTP traffic to redirect to HTTPS.

5. **Update Drupal and Modules**:
   - Ensure Drupal core and contributed modules are up-to-date to avoid conflicts or security issues.

6. **Modify Base URL**:
   - Update settings.php file to set the `$base_url` variable to use HTTPS.

7. **Fix Mixed Content Issues**:
   - Ensure all resources (images, scripts, fonts, iframes) are loaded over HTTPS.
   - Update any hardcoded HTTP links to HTTPS in Drupal content and configuration.

8. **Check External Integrations**:
   - Ensure that any third-party integrations, APIs, and external services used by the Drupal site also support HTTPS.

9. **Test for HTTPS**:
   - Use tools like SSL Labs or browsers' developer tools to test and verify the HTTPS configuration.
   
10. **Monitor and Maintain**:
    - Regularly check and renew SSL certificates before expiration.
    - Stay updated with security best practices and promptly apply patches and updates.

These steps will help ensure that the Drupal application complies with the HTTPS-only policy as mandated by the Government Standards Document.
