### Document Summary

**Primary Standards:**
1. **Secure Connections Requirement:**
   - All public federal websites and web services must use HTTPS for secure connections.
   
2. **Deadline:**
   - Existing federal websites must adopt HTTPS with HSTS by December 31, 2016.

3. **New Websites:**
   - New federal websites must comply with HTTPS standards upon launch.
   
4. **Prioritization:**
   - Prioritize HTTPS implementation for sites exchanging PII, sensitive content, or high traffic.

5. **Intranet:**
   - HTTPS is encouraged for intranets but not required.

**Security:**
1. **HTTPS Usage:**
   - HTTPS ensures data sent between websites and users is encrypted and protected.
   
2. **Trustworthiness:**
   - HTTPS verifies the websiteâ€™s identity and helps prevent impersonation.
   
3. **HSTS:**
   - Enforce HSTS to prevent downgrading attacks and ensure HTTPS is used in future connections.

**Accessibility:**
1. **Public Access:**
   - All public-facing federal websites and services must be accessible via HTTPS.
   
2. **Mixed Content:**
   - Ensure all website resources (images, scripts, etc.) are loaded over HTTPS to avoid security issues.

**User Experience:**
1. **Consistency:**
   - Provide a consistent, private browsing experience across all federal websites.
   
2. **Performance:**
   - Modern systems handle HTTPS without major performance impacts; some protocols may even improve it.

**Compliance:**
1. **Risk-Based Deployment:**
   - Agencies should use a risk-based approach to prioritize which websites to migrate first.
   
2. **Monitoring:**
   - Compliance can be monitored via the public dashboard at https://pulse.cio.gov.
  
3. **Technical Assistance:**
   - Seek guidance and best practices from https://HTTPS.cio.gov.
