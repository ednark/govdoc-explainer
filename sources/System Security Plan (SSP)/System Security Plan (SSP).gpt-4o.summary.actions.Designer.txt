From a Designer's perspective, specializing in Human Centered Design and responsible for the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) of the application, the minimal list of actions to show compliance with government standards includes:

1. **Accessibility Compliance**:
   - Ensure all UI components meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
   - Implement keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.

2. **Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Compatibility**:
   - Design for consistent functionality and appearance across different browsers and devices.
   - Test UI elements across various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

3. **Secure User Authentication**:
   - Follow guidelines for secure password design and user authentication mechanisms.
   - Ensure user authentication interfaces are designed for usability without compromising security.

4. **Data Privacy Notices**:
   - Clearly display privacy notices and data use consent forms at appropriate points in the user journey.
   - Design intuitive consent interfaces that are easy to understand.

5. **Intuitive User Flows**:
   - Create user flows that are intuitive and minimize complexity in accessing services.
   - Ensure the information provided is clear and easy to understand.

6. **Separation of Duties in UI**:
   - Design interfaces that respect role-based access controls to prevent unauthorized actions.
   - Ensure users only see UI elements that are relevant to their role.

7. **Consistent and Clear Communication**:
   - Use plain language in UI text, labels, and help documentation as recommended in FedRAMP's user guide policies.
   - Incorporate clearly marked error messages and informative feedback mechanisms.

8. **Illustrated System Architecture and Data Flows**:
   - Include detailed diagrams showing data flow and system architecture within the application interfaces where necessary.
   - Ensure that end-users can understand the system architecture if relevant to their interaction with the application.

9. **Compliance with Cryptographic Standards**:
   - Design interfaces that indicate when and where cryptographic measures (like encrypted communication) are in use.
   - Ensure all forms that handle sensitive data clearly mark encrypted data fields.

10. **User Guide and Documentation Accessibility**:
   - Design user guides and documentation to be easily accessible and understandable for different user roles.
   - Ensure all documentation related to the UI is compliant with security and useability standards.

By focusing on these actions, a Designer can ensure that the web application aligns with government standards from a UX/UI perspective.
