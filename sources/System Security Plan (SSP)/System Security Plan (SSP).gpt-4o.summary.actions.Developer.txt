For a developer specializing in implementing Drupal and responsible for the backend business logic, here is a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with government standards:

1. **Implement FIPS-Validated Cryptography**:
   - Use FIPS 140-validated cryptographic modules for data at rest (DAR) and data in transit (DIT).
   - Only use cryptographic algorithms listed as approved in the cryptographic module's security policy.

2. **Submit System Security Plan (SSP) Components**:
   - Ensure elements relevant to backend functionalities, like services, ports, and protocols, are documented and mapped as required by the SSP.
   - Provide necessary system information and data flow details to be included in the SSP.

3. **Apply Security Configurations Compliance**:
   - Adhere to security configuration guidelines specified in the Configuration Management Plan (CMP).
   - Maintain a secure configuration baseline for Drupal and any related external integrations.

4. **Support for Identity Assurance**:
   - Implement and support identity proofing, authentication, and federation assurance levels as mapped to NIST SP 800-63.
   - Ensure the backend logic aligns with selected digital identity levels for authentication mechanisms.

5. **Document and Enforce Separation of Duties**:
   - Verify and document roles and access privileges for all system users to comply with the security control AC-5 (Separation of Duties).
   - Implement role-based access controls within the Drupal application as specified.

6. **Handle Non-FedRAMP Authorized Services**:
   - Appropriately handle and secure interactions with any external systems and services not having FedRAMP authorization.
   - Ensure non-FedRAMP authorized connections are documented with security measures in place.

7. **Support Incident Reporting and Response**:
   - Implement backend support for logging and monitoring prerequisites for incident response as outlined in the Incident Response Plan (IRP).
   - Enable necessary logging functionalities within Drupal to capture security events.

8. **Continuous Monitoring Compliance**:
   - Implement monitoring hooks and support for continuous monitoring as specified.
   - Ensure backend systems provide necessary telemetry for the Continuous Monitoring Plan.

By focusing on these tasks, the developer can contribute significantly to ensuring the Drupal backend logic complies with stipulated government standards.
