SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN APPROVALS

Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Signatures
By signing this System Security Plan (SSP), we agree that it is complete and is the current version to be used for the security assessment. The FedRAMP-specific Laws and Regulations Document, as of the date of this SSP, is <Insert Version X.X>, dated <Insert MM/DD/YYYY>, and is posted on the FedRAMP Documents and Templates webpage. The CSO-related laws and regulations, beyond those required by FedRAMP, are captured in Appendix L.



Introduction
The SSP is the “security blueprint” of a CSO. The SSP defines a CSO’s authorization boundary and describes the security controls in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the system and federal data it holds.  
Purpose
This document is intended to be used by CSPs that are pursuing a Joint Authorization Board (JAB) provisional authorization to operate (P-ATO) or an agency authorization to operate (ATO) through the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).
System Information

Table 3.1 provides a summary of the key attributes of the CSO.
Table 3.1 System Information

System Owner
The following individual is identified as the system owner or functional proponent/advocate for this system. The system owner is the official responsible for the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an information system.

Following each of the diagrams, there is a narrative that describes the <Insert CSO Name> boundary components, functionality, as well as interactions and flows among internal components and external systems/services. If using several illustrations, each must have a narrative.

Services, Ports, and Protocols
Table 9.1 lists the service names, port numbers, and transport protocols enabled in <Insert CSO Name>. These must be specifically called out per the security control requirements in CM-7, CM-7(1), RA-5, SA-4, SA-9(2), and SA-9(4).

Cryptographic Modules Implemented for Data At Rest (DAR) and Data In Transit (DIT)

The use of cryptography is critical for all systems that process and/or store federal data. Federal policy requires that anywhere that cryptography is required, it must employ FIPS 140-validated cryptographic modules. The Appendix Q cryptographic modules tables specify the encryption status for <Insert CSO Name>. These tables include reference numbers that are specified in <Insert Figure Number(s) (refer to the diagrams in the SSP depicting encryption status, typically data flow, if not combined)> in Section 8 of this SSP that depict the specific data stores and flows related to <Insert CSO Name>.
 <Insert CSP Name> confirms, except where clearly noted in Appendix Q, that <Insert CSO Name> employs FIPS-validated cryptographic modules (CMs) that are configured in an approved mode, which is documented in the associated Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) security policy for the FIPS-validated certificate number. Only algorithms listed, as approved, in the CM’s security policy are used. The encryption discussed, in Appendix Q, is validated by an IA during a security assessment. 

Separation of Duties
Security control AC-5, Separation of Duties, requires that CSPs identify and document the roles of all individuals who access the system and define the access authorizations that support protections from bad actors, employee collusion, fraud, etc. before damage occurs. Table 11.1 captures the roles and access privileges for all individuals or roles that access <Insert CSO Name>.

Mapping FedRAMP Levels to NIST SP 800-63 Levels
Digital identity is the process of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system. Authentication focuses on the identity proofing process, the authenticator management process, and the assertion protocol used in a federated environment to communicate authentication and attribute information, if applicable. 
Table E.1, below, “Mapping FedRAMP Levels to NIST SP 800-63 Levels”, maps the FedRAMP impact levels (Low/LI-SaaS, Moderate, and High) to NIST SP 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines levels:
Identity Assurance Level (IAL) - Refers to the identity proofing process
Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) - Refers to the authentication process
Federation Assurance Level (FAL) - Refers to the strength of an assertion in a federated environment, used to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable), to a relying party (RP)

Digital Identity Level Selection
The <Insert CSP Name> has identified that they support the digital identity level that has been selected for the <Insert CSO Name>. The selected digital identity level indicated is supported for federal agency consumers of the CSO. Implementation details of the digital identity mechanisms are provided in Appendix A under control IA-2.

<Insert CSO Name> Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 Categorization

The FIPS 199 Categorization (Security Categorization) report is a key component of the security authorization package developed for submission to FedRAMP authorizing officials. The FIPS 199 Categorization report below includes the determination of the security impact level for the <Insert CSO Name> cloud environment. 
Note: This report is initially completed by the CSP in anticipation of what the actual federal data that might be stored, processed, and transmitted. Each agency must do this FIPS 199 analysis for their own data flows to ensure compatibility with the overall criticality level.
The <Insert CSO Name> system has been determined to have a security categorization of <Insert CSO Security Categorization Level>, as determined in Table K.1.
Impact levels are determined for each information type based on the security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability). The confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact levels define the security sensitivity category of each information type. The FIPS 199 is the High watermark for the impact level of all the applicable information types. 
Table K.1 uses the NIST SP 800-60 (current revision) Volume II Appendices to Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories to identify information types with the security impacts.
