For a Designer focusing on Human-Centered Design, User Experience (UX), and User Interface (UI) of a web application, here are the minimal actions required to show compliance with the relevant government standards:

1. **Access Control Integration**:
   - Ensure login interfaces support secure authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

2. **Audit and Accountability Features**:
   - Design UI elements to log user actions, where applicable, in a user-friendly manner.

3. **Identification and Authentication**:
   - Design interfaces that capture and securely store user credentials.

4. **User Education**:
   - Integrate UX design that includes security awareness prompts and information.

5. **Configuration Management Awareness**:
   - Provide clear UI layout for administrative controls that handle system configurations.

6. **Contingency Planning UX**:
   - Design user interfaces that guide users through backup and emergency operation procedures.

7. **Incident Response Integration**:
   - Ensure the application has intuitive ways for users to report security incidents or issues.

8. **Maintenance Notifications**:
   - Design clear and timely UI notifications for scheduled system maintenance.

9. **Media Protection and Sanitization**:
   - Ensure that any file upload/download features include prompts for sanitizing sensitive data.

10. **Physical and Environmental Considerations**:
    - Design for accessibility that accounts for user needs in different environments.

11. **Personnel Security Notices**:
    - Include visual reminders of security protocols for users with higher-level access.

12. **System Integrity Indicators**:
    - Implement UI indicators that notify users of system integrity issues (e.g., malware detection prompts).

13. **Security Planning Transparency**:
    - Provide a user-friendly way to view and understand security policies and rules of behavior.

By focusing on these specific actions, a Designer can ensure that the UX and UI elements of the web application align with the critical security standards required by government regulations.
