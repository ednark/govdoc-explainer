To ensure compliance with the Government Standards Document from the perspective of a Drupal developer, here is a minimal list of actions:

1. **Access Control Implementation**:
   - Ensure user roles and permissions are correctly configured.
   - Implement access controls to limit access to sensitive data.

2. **Audit and Accountability Setup**:
   - Enable logging for user activities.
   - Ensure logs are protected and retained for monitoring and auditing.

3. **Identification and Authentication**:
   - Use secure authentication methods (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
   - Ensure unique user identification for accountability.

4. **Communication Protection**:
   - Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.
   - Monitor and control access to APIs and external services.

5. **Configuration Management**:
   - Maintain and document a baseline configuration for all environments.
   - Enforce restrictions on unauthorized changes to configuration.

6. **Incident Response Preparations**:
   - Set up alerts and notifications for security incidents.
   - Document and test response procedures for potential security events.

7. **System Maintenance**:
   - Regularly update Drupal core and modules.
   - Document and control the maintenance processes.

8. **Media Protection**:
   - Implement access controls on database backups.
   - Sanitize media before reuse or disposal.

9. **Physical and Environmental Protection**:
   - Ensure that the hosting environment meets physical security requirements.

10. **Personnel Security**:
    - Ensure team members have the necessary security clearances.
    - Implement access revocation procedures for terminated or transferred staff.

11. **System and Information Integrity**:
    - Enable protections against malicious code.
    - Regularly monitor and apply patches for vulnerabilities.

12. **Security Planning**:
    - Complete and maintain a system security plan.
    - Define and enforce acceptable use policies for users.

13. **Risk Assessment**:
    - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and risk analyses.

14. **System and Services Acquisition**:
    - Evaluate and document security controls for third-party services.

15. **File Transfer Controls**:
    - Implement secure methods for file uploads and downloads.
    - Monitor and restrict unauthorized file transfers.

By focusing on these actions, developers will help ensure that their Drupal web applications comply with the outlined government security standards.
