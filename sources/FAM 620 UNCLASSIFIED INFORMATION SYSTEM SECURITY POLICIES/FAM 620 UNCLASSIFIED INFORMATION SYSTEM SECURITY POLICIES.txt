UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY POLICIES
(TL:DS-278;   08-11-2017)
(Office of Origin:  DS/CTS)
12 FAM 621
PURPOSE
(TL:DS-278;   08-11-2017)
a. To establish the minimum mandatory security policies
for managing risk that results from threats and vulnerabilities that could
impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Sensitive But
Unclassified (SBU) and non-sensitive unclassified information and application
systems that support the operations and assets of the Department.
b. The National Institute of Standards (NIST), Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for
Federal Information and Information Systems, mandates all agencies implement
these policies.  These policies align with the NIST Special Publication (SP)
800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and
Organizations, Revision 4.
c.  Per the NIST FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization
of Federal Information and Information Systems, the Department must categorize
its information/application systems as either: Low [L], Moderate [M] or High
[H] Impact (See
12 FAH-10 H-332
). 
The applicability of the security controls listed below depends on the impact
level assigned to the system.  For example, if the paragraph has [L,M,H] at the
end, it means that the control applies to all systems.  An [M] at the end
indicates that the control only applies to moderate impact systems.  For more information
on whether your system is categorized as [L], [M], or [H], see the system owner
or contact the Office of Information Assurance (IRM/IA).
d. The
Directorate of
Cyber and Technology Security
(DS/
CTS
),
in coordination with IRM/IA, will annually review and update, as necessary, the
security policies in this subchapter.
NOTE
:  NIST SP 800-53 security
control identifiers may appear at the end of a section heading (e.g., PS-1).
