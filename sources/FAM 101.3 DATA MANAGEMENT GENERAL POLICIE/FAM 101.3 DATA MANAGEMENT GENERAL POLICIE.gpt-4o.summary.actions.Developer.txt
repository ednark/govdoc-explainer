To ensure compliance with the relevant government standards from the perspective of a Drupal developer, here is a minimal list of actions:

1. **Data Openness Presumption**: Ensure the web application is designed to prioritize data sharing and availability, while also respecting confidentiality, privacy, and security requirements.
  
2. **Data Privacy Protections**: Implement measures to protect personally identifiable information (PII) according to the Privacy Act of 1974.

3. **FOIA Compliance**: Make non-exempt data available for public access in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

4. **Access Controls**: Develop robust access control mechanisms to enforce data protection for sensitive information restricted by law, confidentiality agreements, and security requirements.

5. **Metadata Publication**: Ensure that your web application includes functionality to publish metadata about the data being stored and managed, even if the actual data access is restricted.

6. **Data Preparation and Interoperability**: Follow enterprise standards and guidance for preparing data for storage and use, enabling data movement and consolidation between systems.

7. **Records Management**: Implement features that ensure data is either archived or disposed of according to the applicable records retention policies described in 5 FAM 400.

8. **Documentation**: Include documentation within the application that justifies the non-sharing of certain datasets in the Departmentâ€™s Enterprise Data Inventory, when applicable.

By following these steps, a Drupal developer can ensure their web application complies with the relevant government data management standards.
