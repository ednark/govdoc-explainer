Data management GENERAL POLICIES
(CT:DATA-1;   12-22-2022)
(Office of origin:  M/SS/CFA)
20 FAM 101.3-1
general policies
(CT:DATA-1;   12-22-2022)
a. Pursuant to the Foundations for Evidence-Based
Policymaking Act of 2018 and
1 FAM 044
,
the Chief Data Officer (CDO) and the Center for Analytics in the Office of
Management Strategy & Solutions (M/SS/CfA) are authorized to administer and
manage data management policies and processes at the Department. Under the Act,
the CDO holds broad data management roles and responsibilities at the
Department. Because the CDO also acts as the Managing Director of M/SS/CfA, the
organization supports the CDO as they fulfill duties related to data management
at the Department. The CDO and the M/SS/CfA work with the Enterprise Data
Council (EDC) to ensure that bureaus/posts/offices’ varied interests are
considered. b. Per OMB M-10-06 and M-13-13, "agencies must
adopt a presumption in favor of openness to the extent permitted by law and
subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid
restrictions." Accordingly, data not exempt under the above policies
should be made available within the Department. Where technical limitations
exist, parties will work to prioritize sharing to meet Department and
Government-wide goals. Restrictions may include but are not limited to
licensing agreements, personally-identifiable information (PII) protected
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (also known as the Privacy Act of 1974); information
exempted from mandatory public disclosure in accordance with 5 U.S.C.</div><div id="chunk-1" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 552
(Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)); information within systems covered under
attorney-client privilege or attorney work product; information restricted from
release due to classification; and information controls on secondary release
and dissemination of technical documents and as defined by Diplomatic Security. c.  M/SS/CfA will maintain enterprise standards in the
form of the Master Reference Data (MRD) and in partnership with Department Data
Stewards and system developers. M/SS/CfA will also provide guidance on how to
prepare data for storage and use and provide an environment for
interoperability so that data can be moved and consolidated within and between
individual/unique data stores and applications. d. Bureaus/posts/offices must publish information about
the data they hold, including relevant metadata, even if access to any of the
data must remain restricted, in the Department’s Enterprise Data
Inventory. If data cannot be shared in the Department’s Enterprise Data
Catalog, there must be a justification on why not. e. Data must either be archived for records
preservation or disposed of in accordance with applicable records retention
policies and/or its published records retention schedule – see
5
FAM 400
for guidance. UNCLASSIFIED (U)</div></div>

                        <div class="accordion-content"><p>Sure, here are the minimal list of actions for a Designer to ensure compliance with the government standards for a web application:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Adopt Open Design Principles:</strong>
   - Favor openness in design where possible, balancing usability and security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong>
   - Ensure PII and other sensitive information are handled according to privacy restrictions (e.g., mask or encrypt data fields).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility:</strong>
   - Follow accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to make the application usable for people with disabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Metadata:</strong>
   - Design interfaces that allow display and management of data metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Transparency:</strong>
   - Incorporate features that clearly communicate any data sharing and privacy policies to users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Records Information:</strong>
   - Design archiving and disposal options in accordance with records retention policies (e.g., clear user options and notifications for data archiving).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interoperability:</strong>
   - Ensure design allows for data interoperability, such as modular interfaces for data import/export.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By concentrating on these key actions, a designer can ensure that user interfaces and experience components of a web application are aligned with the relevant portions of the government standards.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Data Openness Presumption</strong>: Ensure the web application is designed to prioritize data sharing and availability, while also respecting confidentiality, privacy, and security requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Privacy Protections</strong>: Implement measures to protect personally identifiable information (PII) according to the Privacy Act of 1974.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FOIA Compliance</strong>: Make non-exempt data available for public access in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Access Controls</strong>: Develop robust access control mechanisms to enforce data protection for sensitive information restricted by law, confidentiality agreements, and security requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metadata Publication</strong>: Ensure that your web application includes functionality to publish metadata about the data being stored and managed, even if the actual data access is restricted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Preparation and Interoperability</strong>: Follow enterprise standards and guidance for preparing data for storage and use, enabling data movement and consolidation between systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Records Management</strong>: Implement features that ensure data is either archived or disposed of according to the applicable records retention policies described in 5 FAM 400.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Include documentation within the application that justifies the non-sharing of certain datasets in the Department’s Enterprise Data Inventory, when applicable.</p></li>
