Sure, here's a minimal list of actions a project manager must take to show compliance with the FedRAMP Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) standards for a web application:

1. **Identify and List Weaknesses:**
   Ensure all potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities discovered through scans or assessments are documented.

2. **Assign POAM IDs:**
   Assign unique identifiers to each weakness for tracking purposes.

3. **Appoint Points of Contact:**
   Designate responsible persons for each task related to mitigating the identified weaknesses.

4. **Create Remediation Plans:**
   Develop a detailed plan for addressing and resolving each weakness identified.

5. **Set Milestones and Deadlines:**
   Define specific milestones and deadlines for each step in the remediation plan, including an original detection date and a scheduled completion date.

6. **Track Milestone Changes:**
   Monitor any changes to milestones, documenting the reasons and new dates.

7. **Vendor Dependency Management:**
   Identify dependencies on any vendors and establish regular check-ins to ensure dependencies do not delay remediation.

8. **Risk Ratings:**
   Assess and record both the original and adjusted risk ratings for each identified weakness.

9. **Deviation Requests:**
   Document any deviation requests, including rationale and supporting documents when a standard procedure cannot be followed.

10. **Evidence Documentation:**
    Maintain supporting documents such as remediation evidence, deviation requests, and any other pertinent documentation.

11. **Known Vulnerabilities Compliance:**
    Cross-reference identified weaknesses with the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalog and track related deadlines.

12. **Regular Updates:**
    Provide regular status updates both internally and to the client, ensuring ongoing transparency and communication.

By following these steps, a project manager can effectively organize, track, and guide tasks to ensure compliance with relevant government standards for web applications.
