A minimal list of actions for a DevOps technician to ensure a web application project adheres to FedRAMP standards can include:

1. **Identify Assets and Inventory**: Maintain an up-to-date list of all infrastructure assets, including servers, databases, and networking components, with unique identifiers.

2. **Vulnerability Scans**: Regularly run vulnerability scans using approved tools (e.g., Nessus, Qualys) and document the findings.

3. **Control Implementation**: Ensure implementation of required security controls as per FedRAMP guidelines, particularly those applicable to the infrastructure (e.g., AC-1 for access control).

4. **Risk Assessment**: Perform and document risk assessments to categorize the impact level of assets (e.g., Low, Moderate, High).

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up logging and real-time monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities and to ensure logs are retained as per guidelines.

6. **Patch Management**: Implement and follow a patch management process to ensure systems are regularly updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.

7. **Configuration Management**: Maintain and enforce secure configuration baselines for all infrastructure components.

8. **Incident Response Plan**: Establish and test an incident response plan that aligns with federal guidelines, including communication protocols and remediation steps.

9. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls, ensuring least privilege principles and regular review of user privileges.

10. **Documentation and Compliance**: Keep thorough documentation of all implemented processes, configurations, and compliance checks for audit purposes.

11. **Vendor Management**: Regularly check in with vendors to ensure their products comply with required security standards and update as necessary.

12. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Develop, test, and maintain a disaster recovery plan to sustain operations in case of an unexpected event.

By following these steps, a DevOps technician can contribute significantly towards maintaining FedRAMP compliance for the web application infrastructure.
