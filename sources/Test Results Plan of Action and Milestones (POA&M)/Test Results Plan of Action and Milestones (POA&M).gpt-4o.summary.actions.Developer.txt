For a Developer specializing in implementing Drupal, here is a minimal list of actions to show compliance with FedRAMP standards for a web application:

1. **Adhere to Access Controls:**
   - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) within Drupal.
   - Ensure proper user authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.

2. **Identify and Mitigate Weaknesses:**
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like Nessus or Qualys.
   - Fix any identified vulnerabilities in custom or contributed Drupal modules.

3. **Monitor Open Ports:**
   - Review and ensure no unnecessary ports are open on Drupal server environments.
   - Disable or restrict access to admin paths to specific IP addresses if feasible.

4. **Implement Secure Configuration:**
   - Disable unnecessary Drupal modules and ensure configurations follow security best practices.
   - Apply updates and security patches promptly to Drupal core and all modules.

5. **Maintain Secure Connections:**
   - Enforce HTTPS/SSL for all external communication.
   - Use secure protocols for any backend services or APIs integrated with Drupal.

6. **Document and Track Changes:**
   - Keep comprehensive logs of all changes to the Drupal codebase and configuration.
   - Maintain a record of detected vulnerabilities and actions taken for remediation.

7. **Conduct Regular Risk Assessments:**
   - Periodically review the Drupal site for compliance against security controls.
   - Adjust risk assessments based on findings and implement appropriate mitigation strategies.

8. **Vendor Dependency Management:**
   - Track and document any vendor dependencies in use within the Drupal system.
   - Regularly check for updates or vulnerability notices from module maintainers or vendors.

9. **Prepare for Incident Response:**
   - Implement a plan for rapidly addressing security incidents, including contact points and procedures.
   - Test response plans to ensure efficiency and readiness.

By following these actions, a developer can contribute to ensuring that the Drupal-based application adheres to necessary FedRAMP standards, focusing on backend and logical implementations.
