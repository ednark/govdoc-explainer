Absolutely, keeping the user experience and interface in mind, here are the minimal actions a Designer should take to comply with government standards:

1. **Ensure Section 508 Compliance**  
   - Design all interfaces to be accessible to users with disabilities (follow 36 CFR 1194 standards).
2. **User Authentication Procedures**  
   - Implement and design support for E-Authentication guidelines (OMB M-04-04).
3. **Secure Design Principles**  
   - Follow guidelines for secure user information handling and ensure interface designs include features that support Cyber Security, such as secure login mechanisms (FISMA compliance).
4. **Use PIV Cards for Access**  
   - Design interfaces to accommodate the use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards for authentication.
5. **Provide Alternative Access Methods**  
   - If some functionality is non-compliant due to technical limitations, ensure that alternative means of access are provided for users with disabilities.
6. **Document Accessibility Features**  
   - Maintain clear documentation of all accessibility features and user guidance materials.
7. **Regular Usability Testing**  
   - Conduct usability testing with individuals with disabilities to ensure compliance and identify potential improvements.
8. **Comply with Agency Guidelines**  
   - Ensure all design elements follow the relevant agency guidelines and standardized formats as specified by the local CCB and the Departmentâ€™s IT CCB.
9. **Implement Consistent User Experience**  
   - Ensure design consistency across all pages and features, adhering to the Department's overall Enterprise Architecture (EA) design principles.
10. **Stay Informed of Updates**  
    - Regularly review updates and guidance from the IMPACT initiative and other relevant bodies to stay current with compliance requirements.

These actions will help ensure that the web application design not only adheres to the required standards but also delivers a user-centered experience that is accessible and secure.
