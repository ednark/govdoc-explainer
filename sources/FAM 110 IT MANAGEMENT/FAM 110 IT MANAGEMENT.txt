POLICY FOR ACCESS TO IT FOR
INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES
(CT:IM-143;   07-12-2013)
a. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29
U.S.C. 794d) and relevant implementing regulations (36 CFR 1194) require
Federal departments and agencies that develop, procure, maintain, or use
electronic and information technology to ensure that Federal employees and
members of the public with disabilities have access to and use of information
and data, comparable to that of the employees and members of the public without
disabilities unless it is an undue burden to do so.  If an agency invokes the undue
burden exception, the statute requires that the information and data be
provided to individuals with disabilities by an alternative means of access.

administers the SIP, including the IT Skills Incentive Panel (see
5 FAM 118.1
)
and the Senior Advisory Panel (see
5 FAM 118.2
). 
These organizations review SIP continuously, along with sustainment training,
to meet the Department’s needs (see the SIP website for more information
on SIP including eligibility and approved job series.)

Development (USAID) are panel member representatives.  The respective heads of
the above bureaus appoint their representatives, except that each functional
and regional bureau will appoint one representative on an annual rotational
basis when that bureau is scheduled to have a representative on the panel.  The
IT Skills Incentive Program Panel makes policy recommendations to the Senior
Advisory Panel.  The recommendations are not limited to policies, but include
other changes such as adding or deleting certifications and/or credentials, and
limiting or extending the timeframes of these certifications/credentials.

Security Officer and the Senior Coordinator for Security Infrastructure.
b. ISSC members advise and instruct in a consultative
and collaborative manner that stresses transparency, responsiveness, and
cooperation.  This enables an information security program that is
