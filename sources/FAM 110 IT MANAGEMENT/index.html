POLICY FOR ACCESS TO IT FOR
INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES
(CT:IM-143;   07-12-2013)
a. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

electronic and information technology to ensure that Federal employees and
members of the public with disabilities have access to and use of information
and data, comparable to that of the employees and members of the public without
disabilities unless it is an undue burden to do so. If an agency invokes the undue
burden exception, the statute requires that the information and data be
provided to individuals with disabilities by an alternative means of access. b.</div><div id="chunk-12" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> The Information Resource Management Program for

Development (USAID) are panel member representatives. The respective heads of
the above bureaus appoint their representatives, except that each functional
and regional bureau will appoint one representative on an annual rotational
basis when that bureau is scheduled to have a representative on the panel.</div><div id="chunk-13" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The
