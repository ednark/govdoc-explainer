As a Drupal developer tasked with implementing the backend logic for a web application in compliance with the provided Government Standards Document, here is a summarized list of essential actions:

1. **Establish Digital Governance:**
   - Implement structured and documented governance for digital services including websites and data, ensuring alignment with the Digital Government Strategy.

2. **Utilize Analytics and User Feedback:**
   - Integrate the General Service Administrationâ€™s (GSA) Digital Analytics Program (DAP) tracking code into the application for analytic insights.
   - Design feedback mechanisms, such as surveys or comment forms, to gather customer insights efficiently.

3. **Ensure Discoverability and SEO Optimization:**
   - Implement a robust search functionality for the web application and ensure all content is indexable by search engines.

4. **Open Data and API Management:**
   - Provide public access to open data through a structured URL (e.g., www.[agency].gov/data.json) using a standard metadata schema.
   - Ensure APIs for public services are accessible and documented at a designated developer portal (e.g., www.[agency].gov/developer).

5. **Responsive Design for Multiple Devices:**
   - Ensure that the web application employs responsive design principles to be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. **Privacy and Data Security:**
   - Implement comprehensive privacy guidelines, ensuring all personal data is handled in compliance with federal laws (like the Privacy Act of 1974).
   - Maintain an updated privacy policy and privacy program page (e.g., www.[agency].gov/privacy).

7. **Accessibility Standards:**
   - Adhere to Section 508 accessibility standards, making sure the application is accessible to individuals with disabilities.
  
8. **Information Security:**
   - Follow prescribed standards and guidelines for information security as per FISMA and NIST publications.
   - Regularly update and patch security systems to protect data and infrastructure.

9. **Implement HTTPS Protocols:**
   - Ensure all public-facing services are delivered over HTTPS to secure communications and user data.

10. **Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements:**
    - Regularly update compliance with the various regulations including records management, plain writing, multilingual content, and IPv6 requirements.

11. **Regular Updates and Maintenance:**
   - Provide continuous updates and maintenance to meet evolving requirements and address any newly identified issues or vulnerabilities.

Each of these items directly impacts the architectural, implementation, or operational aspects of backend development using Drupal in a government context, adhering to high standards of security, usability, and accessibility.
