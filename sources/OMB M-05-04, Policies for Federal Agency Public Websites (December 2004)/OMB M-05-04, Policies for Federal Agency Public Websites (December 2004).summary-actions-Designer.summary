Certainly! From a Human-Centered Design perspective focusing on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) for a Designer working on web applications in compliance with the standards mentioned in the Government Standards Document, here are the key actions to take:

1. **Establish Integral Digital Governance**: Incorporate a governance plan for digital services, ensuring it aligns with wider agency strategies and clearly defines user engagement, service delivery, and performance standards. Update your agency's digital strategy page accordingly.

2. **Use Analytics and User Feedback**: Implement tracking via the General Service Administrationâ€™s (GSA) Digital Analytics Program (DAP) on all public-facing websites, using both quantitative analytics for continuous improvements and qualitative feedback to address user needs and behaviors.

3. **Ensure Website and Service Accessibility**: Design and regularly update websites to be fully usable for people with disabilities in compliance with Section 508, ensuring that all new functions are tested for accessibility.

4. **Secure Connections (HTTPS)**: Ensure all sites and services operate under HTTPS to protect user data and privacy. 

5. **Responsive Design for Multiple Devices**: Develop websites using responsive design methodologies to ensure usability across different devices, like mobiles and tablets, thus providing equitable access to government information.

6. **Maintain Privacy and Inform Users**: Design websites and digital services that respect user privacy. Clear and accessible privacy policies should be placed appropriately, and a comprehensive Privacy Program Page must be developed and maintained.

7. **Create Searchable and Discoverable Content**: Implement efficient search functions and optimize content for search engines to ensure users can easily find information. Utilize GSA's available search solutions if necessary.

8. **Provide Information with Quality and Accuracy**: Clearly display limitations of the information provided and regularly market the quality and integrity of the content, especially in external communications or links.

9. **Implement Plain Language Usage**: Ensure all web content is clear, concise, and well-organized to comply with the Plain Writing Act, enhancing user comprehension and engagement.

10. **Multilingual Content Provision**: Determine necessary website content to be offered in multiple languages, based on user needs and agency mission, to accommodate non-English speakers.

11. **Public Engagement through Open Data**: Make data easily accessible and machine-readable with proper documentation to encourage public participation and transparency, e.g., through a data.json and a human-readable Public Data Listing.

12. **Present Consistent Look and Feel**: Utilize the U.S. Website Design Standards to ensure a uniform appearance and usability across all digital platforms, providing a seamless user experience.

Each of these actions not only ensures compliance with the standards but also emphasizes a user-first approach to design and development, crucial for successful and effective public engagement through digital government services.
