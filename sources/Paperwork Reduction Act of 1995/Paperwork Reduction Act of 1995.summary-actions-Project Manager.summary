To ensure that your project complies with the standards outlined by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 as a Project Manager, you should undertake the following actions for your web application project:

1. **Identify Information Collections:** Catalog all elements within the web application where information is collected from the public. This includes forms, surveys, user registrations, and any other data input mechanisms.

2. **Assess Necessity and Burden:** Evaluate the necessity of each data collection point and estimate the time it will take for the public to provide this information, ensuring that it is justified and minimized.

3. **Prepare OMB Submission:** Compile the necessary documentation and justifications for the information collections identified. This should include a thorough description of the information being collected, the purpose for its collection, and a demonstration of its necessity.

4. **Seek OMB Approval:** Submit the documentation to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval before the web application begins collecting information from the public. Include any required justifications and burden estimates.

5. **Implement Approved Methods:** Once OMB approval is obtained, ensure that the web application implements the data collection methods as approved. Any deviations or changes to these methods post-approval must be resubmitted to OMB for re-approval.

6. **Review and Renew:** Regularly review the information collection aspects of the web application to ensure ongoing compliance with the PRA, and renew OMB approval as required (typically every three years).

7. **Document Compliance:** Maintain thorough documentation of all steps taken to comply with the PRA, including copies of OMB submissions and approvals.

By following these steps, you will guide your team and the client effectively in adhering to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act and avoiding unnecessary delays or legal complications in deploying the web application.
