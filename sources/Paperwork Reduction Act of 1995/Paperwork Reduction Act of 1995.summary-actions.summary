To ensure compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) when engaging in a web application project, take the following action steps:

1. **Determine Applicability**:
   - Confirm if your web application will involve collection of information from the public, as almost any interaction might qualify under “information collections” (e.g., forms, surveys, or registrations).

2. **Seek OMB Approval**:
   - If applicable, prepare an information collection request that adheres to PRA standards and obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before implementing these elements on your application.

3. **Document Service Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Since collecting feedback on service delivery may take advantage of the Fast-Track Process outlined in OMB M-11-26, design feedback tools that adhere to this guideline, ensuring efficient and compliant feedback collection.

4. **Incorporate Streamlined Service Strategies**:
   - Refer to and implement principles from Executive Order 13571 to streamline service delivery and enhance customer service on your application.

5. **Leverage Appropriate Technology**:
   - Use social media and web-based technologies effectively, as guided by the specifics mentioned in the document titled “Social Media, Web-Based Interactive Technologies, and the Paperwork Reduction Act.”

6. **Understand Related Legislations**:
   - Be aware of and compliant with related legislations like the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (1998) and the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act (2002) that potentially influence paperwork and electronic transactions.

7. **Review and Use Available Resources**:
   - Utilize resources and guides available from DigitalGov and connected resources to continually align with evolving standards and improve implementations concerning paperwork reduction.

8. **Participate in Training and Updates**:
   - Engage with training sessions, seminars, or consultation meetings to stay updated on compliance procedures and practical implementations of the PRA.

By meticulously following these steps, your web application project will align with PRA standards, ensuring compliance and improving the user experience for the public.
