To ensure compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 from a DevOps perspective, when managing and designing infrastructure for web applications that involve information collection from the public, below are the minimal actionable steps you should follow:

1. **Obtain OMB Approval for Information Collection**: Ensure that any collection of information from the public via web forms, surveys, or other input mechanisms has received approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before being deployed.

2. **Design Agile Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement and maintain fast-track processes for collecting service delivery feedback as per OMB M-11-26. This involves creating efficient, secure, and compliant channels for feedback within the web applications you manage.

3. **Ensure Proper Record Keeping**: Establish systems for secure and compliant data storage that will support the keeping of records as per the stipulations of the PRA. These systems should facilitate easy access to, and retrieval of, information as required by the act.

4. **Streamline Service Delivery Systems**: Following Executive Order 13571, design web interfaces and backend processes that prioritize user-friendliness and efficiency to enhance customer service and streamline service delivery.

5. **Integrate Social Media and Web-based Technologies Compliantly**: When integrating social media and other web-based interactive technologies, ensure compliance with the PRA guidelines and standards, such as the specific directives given in the "Social Media, Web-Based Interactive Technologies, and the Paperwork Reduction Act" document.

6. **Documentation and Compliance Tracking**: Maintain thorough documentation of all procedures and systems used in the collection, storage, and retrieval of public information. Regularly review and update these processes to stay in compliance with the latest PRA requirements.

7. **Facilitate Ongoing Compliance Audits and Training**: Implement regular audits and checks to ensure compliance. Provide training and resources to team members to keep updated with PRA requirements.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the web applications managed and supported by your infrastructure remain in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, which is crucial for avoiding penalties and ensuring smooth operation within government frameworks.
