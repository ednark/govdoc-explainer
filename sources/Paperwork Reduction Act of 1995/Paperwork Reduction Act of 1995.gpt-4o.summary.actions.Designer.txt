For a web application to show compliance with the Government Standards related to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) from the perspective of a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design, the following actions are essential:

1. **Simplify User Forms**: Design forms to collect only essential information needed for government approvals to minimize user burden.

2. **Obtain OMB Approval Reference**: Ensure that any information collection from the public has an OMB approval number displayed on the form or interface.

3. **Provide Clear Instructions**: Design interfaces with clear, concise instructions to help users understand the purpose of information collection and how to complete forms accurately.

4. **Include Privacy Notices**: Incorporate privacy statements that inform users how their data will be used and protected, in line with PRA requirements.

5. **Facilitate Usability Testing**: Conduct regular user testing sessions to gather feedback and ensure the application meets user needs without unnecessary complexity.

6. **Use Accessible Design Standards**: Employ accessibility standards (like WCAG) to ensure all users, including those with disabilities, can access and use the application effectively.

7. **Solicit User Feedback**: Build in mechanisms for users to easily provide feedback on form usability and overall experience, aligning with the fast-track feedback processes under the PRA.

8. **Inform About Data Collection**: Clearly inform users when their data is being collected, why it is being collected, and how long it will be retained.

By focusing on these actions, the Designer can ensure that the web application aligns with the standards and complies with the Paperwork Reduction Act from a user experience perspective.
