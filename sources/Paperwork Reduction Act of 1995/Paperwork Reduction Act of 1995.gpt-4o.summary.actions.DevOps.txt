Certainly! Hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions a DevOps technician must take to ensure compliance with the relevant government standards, specifically focusing on the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA):

1. **Enable Secure Data Collection**:
   - Implement secure forms and data entry points.
   - Ensure encryption of data in transit and at rest.

2. **Access Management**:
   - Configure role-based access controls to restrict who can view and handle collected data.
   - Document access policies and keep records of who accesses sensitive data.

3. **Automate Audit Logs**:
   - Enable logging for all data collection points and access events.
   - Ensure logs are tamper-proof and stored securely.

4. **Service Delivery Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Implement a fast-track process to collect feedback on service delivery as per OMB M-11-26.
   - Use web-based interactive technologies for feedback while ensuring PRA compliance.

5. **Maintain Compliance Documentation**:
   - Keep thorough documentation of compliance with the PRA, including obtained OMB approvals.
   - Regularly update compliance documentation as part of the deployment pipeline.

6. **Data Minimization Practices**:
   - Configure the infrastructure to collect only the necessary data as specified by PRA requirements.
   - Periodically review and minimize data storage to what is essential.

7. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance with government standards.
   - Implement tools for continuous monitoring and alerting of potential compliance breaches.

These actions will help ensure that the web application infrastructure is compliant with the relevant government standards, particularly the PRA, from a DevOps perspective.
