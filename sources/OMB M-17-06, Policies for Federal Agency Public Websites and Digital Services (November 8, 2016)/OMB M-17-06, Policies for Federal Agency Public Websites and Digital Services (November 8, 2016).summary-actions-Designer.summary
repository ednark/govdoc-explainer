As a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design for web applications, focusing on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI), you must ensure compliance with government standards by taking the following actions:

1. **Establish Digital Governance**: Develop and follow a coherent strategy for all digital information and services, ensuring they align with the overarching digital governance plans of the agency.

2. **Focus on User-Centric Design**: Design all web applications around user needs, utilizing analytics and feedback mechanisms to shape and test the design, ensuring effectiveness and satisfaction.

3. **Implement Responsive Design**: Ensure that web applications are accessible and functional across various devices, including non-desktop devices like mobile phones and tablets, by incorporating responsive design principles.

4. **Ensure Accessibility**: Comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act to make sure web applications are accessible to individuals with disabilities. This includes considering all aspects of the user interface and any digital interactions.

5. **Adopt Secure Connections**: Use HTTPS for secure, encrypted connections to protect the privacy and security of user interactions with the web application.

6. **Maintain Privacy and Information Security**: Follow the guidelines for privacy protocols and security measures, which include clear user notices about data collection and protection strategies.

7. **Optimize for Search Engines**: Integrate search engine optimization (SEO) and ensure that content is discoverable by both internal search functions and external search engines, helping users find information quickly and efficiently.

8. **Utilize Approved Domains**: Host applications on approved .gov or .mil domains unless specific exceptions apply, ensuring users recognize the legitimacy and security of the website.

9. **Provide Multilingual Support**: Offer content in multiple languages where necessary to accommodate users with limited English proficiency, based on user demographics and agency mission.

10. **Practice Plain Writing**: Use clear, concise, and jargon-free language conducive to easy comprehension and interaction, adhering to the Plain Writing Act of 2010 for all public-facing content.

11. **Apply Consistent Visual Design**: Use common user interface components and visual styles to ensure a consistent look and feel across the agencyâ€™s digital offerings, improving usability and user confidence.

These action points focus specifically on user experience and interface design within the scope of a government context, ensuring that the design not only meets user needs but also complies with mandatory federal standards.
