To demonstrate compliance with the standards outlined in the Government Standards Document for a web application project, you should adhere to the following actions:

1. **Digital Governance Plan**: Establish and make publicly available a governance plan for digital services, including websites and data management.

2. **Analytics and User Feedback Integration**: Implement the General Services Administrationâ€™s Digital Analytics Program (DAP) on all public-facing websites and actively use qualitative and quantitative data to optimize user experience based on feedback and analytics.

3. **Information Searchability**: Ensure all public-facing content is easily searchable and optimized for common search engines. Employ a search function that meets federal standards, such as GSA's search solution.

4. **Open Data and Public Engagement**: Provide public data in machine-readable formats and maintain an updated Data Publication Process. Engage with the public through feedback mechanisms to improve services.

5. **Mobile Accessibility**: Design websites and digital services that perform equally well on mobile and non-desktop devices using responsive design practices.

6. **Privacy and Security Practices**: Comply with all privacy and security requirements. Ensure that any personal identifiable information (PII) collected is managed transparently and securely. Include a Privacy Program Page, privacy policies, and adhere to privacy law requirements.

7. **Standards for Secure Connections**: Use HTTPS for secure connections on all public-facing federal websites and services to protect user data and privacy.

8. **Proper Use of Domains**: Use only government-approved .gov or .mil domains for all public-facing websites unless an exception is authorized.

9. **Third-Party Compliance**: If using third-party websites and applications, ensure they comply with federal requirements, including privacy and information security protocols.

10. **Content Quality and Accuracy**: Adhere to the Information Quality Act by ensuring information disseminated is useful, objective, and has integrity. Clear communication should be established regarding the quality and limitations of the information provided.

11. **Accessibility for Individuals with Disabilities**: Ensure compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, making digital services accessible to individuals with disabilities, including adherence to accessible technology standards.

12. **Records Management**: Manage all records on websites and third-party services appropriately, ensuring they can be identified, retrieved, and preserved in accordance with federal laws and policies.

13. **Plain Language Use**: Compose all public-facing content in plain language as mandated by the Plain Writing Act of 2010 to ensure it is clear, concise, and understandable to the intended audience.

14. **Multilingual Content**: Provide accessible content for individuals with limited English proficiency based on user needs and agency mission.

15. **IPv6 Implementation**: Ensure that all public-facing servers and services are upgraded to use native IPv6 in accordance with federal requirements.

16. **Consistent Look and Feel**: Adopt common user interface components and visual standards across all agency websites to provide a consistent user experience, utilizing guidelines like the U.S. Website Design Standards.
