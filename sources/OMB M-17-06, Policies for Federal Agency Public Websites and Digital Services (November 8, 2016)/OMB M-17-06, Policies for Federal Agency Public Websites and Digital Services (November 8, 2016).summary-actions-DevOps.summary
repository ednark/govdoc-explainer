To ensure compliance with the standards for managing infrastructure and supporting web applications as a DevOps technician, hereâ€™s a minimal list of actions to take:

1. **Secure HTTPS Connections**: Implement HTTPS on all publicly accessible federal websites and services to secure connections and encrypt data in transit. This complies with OMB Memorandum M-15-13.

2. **Deploy IPv6**: Update all external-facing services to support IPv6 in accordance with federal guidelines and verify compliance with NIST SP 500-267 (IPv6 profile for U.S. Government).

3. **Domain Name Security**: Ensure all domains are up to date with domain name system security extensions to secure the domain name system (DNS) infrastructure, as per OMB Memorandum M-08-23.

4. **Privacy and Security Controls**: Implement and maintain privacy controls and FISMA-required security standards throughout the informational lifecycle, including continuous monitoring and regular assessments.

5. **Information Quality and Accuracy**: Establish mechanisms to ensure all disseminated information is accurate, clear, and reliable. This includes applying management controls and reviewing content regularly to maintain its integrity and utility.

6. **Multilingual and Accessibility Features**: Comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act to make sure digital services are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Additionally, provide multilingual content where necessary as per Department of Justice guidance.

7. **Use Approved Domains**: All federal agency public websites should use ".gov" or ".mil" domains unless an exception is explicitly authorized. Regularly update compliance status on the designated federal dashboard.

8. **Monitor with Analytics**: Incorporate the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) tracking code on all agency websites to collect and analyze site performance and user interaction data.

9. **Data Management and API Accessibility**: Ensure that APIs and data provided are accessible according to open data principles and follow guidelines like those provided in Project Open Data. Ensure compliance with data.json and public feedback mechanisms.

10. **Privacy Policy Disclosure**: Maintain a current and comprehensively explained Privacy Policy, easily accessible, detailing collection, use, and disposal practices of personally identifiable information (PII).

11. **Records Management**: Manage records in accordance with recognized federal records management laws and regulations to ensure proper documentation of digital interactions and transactions.

12. **Responsive Design**: Design websites and digital services to function effectively across a variety of devices, particularly mobile devices, ensuring equal access and usability.

Implementing these practices will help ensure that the infrastructure and web applications you manage as a DevOps technician meet the required government standards and provide a secure, reliable, and efficient digital service environment.
