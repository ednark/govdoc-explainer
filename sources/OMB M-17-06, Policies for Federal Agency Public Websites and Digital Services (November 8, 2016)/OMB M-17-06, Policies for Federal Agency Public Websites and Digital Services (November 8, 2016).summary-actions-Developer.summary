As a Drupal developer implementing backend business logic for web applications compliant with the governmental standards outlined in the document, here is a minimal list of actions you must take:

1. **Adopt Secure Connections**: Implement HTTPS for all federal websites and web services to protect the privacy and security of users. Ensure that secure connections are established, maintained, and validated throughout the application.

2. **Ensure Accessibility (Section 508 Compliance)**: Design and develop the application so that it is accessible to individuals with disabilities. This includes following the Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) Accessibility Standards and ensuring that any new functionality complies with these standards.

3. **Implement Proper Privacy Controls**: Adhere to privacy guidelines by ensuring that Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is securely handled. Create and maintain privacy policies and practices that detail the collection, storage, use, sharing, and disposal of PII.

4. **Data Protection and Information Security**: Follow Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and related OMB and NIST guidelines to safeguard data integrity and security. Develop an agency-wide information security program that covers all managed data.

5. **Data Collection and Quality Assurance**: Make sure that the data collected through the web applications maintains high quality, objectivity, and integrity as per Information Quality Act guidelines. Implement mechanisms to correct data quality issues promptly.

6. **Record Management Compliance**: Manage all records created and maintained with web applications in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. Ensure the identification, storage, retrieval, and disposal of records are carried out efficiently and transparently.

7. **Use of Approved Domains**: For any public-facing federal digital services, including websites, use only approved .gov, .mil, or .edu domains to assure the public of their authenticity and security.

8. **IPv6 Compliance**: Ensure that the web application is compliant with the IPv6 standards to accommodate the required transition from IPv4.

9. **Use Plain Language**: Develop all user interfaces and documentation using plain language to ensure they are easy to understand and use, in compliance with the Plain Writing Act of 2010.

10. **Build for Multilingual Support**: Where necessary, provide multilingual support on web interfaces to cater to users with limited English proficiency, following executive government directives on providing services to people with limited English proficiency.

11. **Maintain a Consistent Look and Feel**: Utilize the U.S. Website Design Standards to ensure a consistent visual and operational feel across various federal websites to enhance usability and accessibility.

12. **Risk Management and Continuous Improvement**: Regularly assess and update security measures and data protection strategies to mitigate emerging risks and technological advancements.

Implementing these measures in your Drupal development projects will help ensure that the web application adheres to federal standards and regulations, providing a secure, accessible, and user-friendly digital service.
