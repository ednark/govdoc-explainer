Certainly! Here is a brief list of actions a Human Centered Designer (Responsible for the User Experience and User Interface) should take to ensure compliance with the relevant government standards:

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is fully responsive for optimal performance on all devices (Section 5A).

2. **Analytics & Feedback**: Implement the GSA's Digital Analytics Program (DAP) tracking code and integrate user feedback mechanisms (Section 2A, 2D).

3. **Search Functionality**: Include a search function on the public website and optimize for commercial search engines (Section 3A, 3B).

4. **Open Data Access**: Implement a machine-readable Public Data Listing following the Project Open Data metadata schema (Section 4).

5. **Privacy Notices**: Create and display privacy policies on all major entry points and on pages collecting PII (Section 6B).

6. **Plain Language**: Ensure all content is written in clear, concise, and well-organized plain language (Section 14).

7. **Accessibility**: Implement and test for compliance with Section 508 and EIT Accessibility Standards (Section 12).

8. **HTTPS Secure Access**: Ensure all web services and websites are accessible through a secure connection (HTTPS) (Section 8).
