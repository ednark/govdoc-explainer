**2. Security and Privacy Focus**
   - Follow policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security and privacy as per government regulations like FISMA and OMB Circular A-130 (Section 7).
   - Utilize HTTPS across all federal websites and web services to protect the privacy and integrity of user interactions (Section 8).

**3. Accessibility Considerations**
   - Comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act to ensure websites are accessible to individuals with disabilities, ensuring that electronic and information technology is accessible and integrating it throughout development and service provision (Section 12).

**4. Quality and Compliance with External Standards**

**Concise Summary:**
Designers should focus on creating user-centric and responsive websites that adhere to federal standards for security, privacy, and accessibility. The websites should provide seamless, search-friendly user experiences, utilize secure connections, and maintain clear and accessible privacy and data usage policies. Compliance with accessibility laws and guidelines like Section 135cts, the Plain Writing Act, and IPv6 adoption are mandatory. Ensuring a consistent aesthetic across government digital services is recommended to enhance user trust and engagement.
