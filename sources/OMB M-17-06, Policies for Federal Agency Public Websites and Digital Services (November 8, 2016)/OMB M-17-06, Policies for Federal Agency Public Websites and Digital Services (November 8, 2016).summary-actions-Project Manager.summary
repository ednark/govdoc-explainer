Comply with the Privacy Act and FISMA requirements for information security.

8. **Adopt Secure Connection Protocols**: Enforce HTTPS to secure the data exchange on federal websites, ensuring privacy and integrity of user information.

9. **Domain Compliance**: Use federally approved domains (.gov or .mil) for all public-facing agency websites and ensure that services are hosted on these secure domains unless explicitly justified otherwise.

10. **Record and Manage Web Content**: Adhere to records management laws and policies to ensure proper documentation and preservation of web content as federal records.

11. **Implement Plain Language Use**: Ensure all website content is clear, concise, and easy to understand in compliance with the Plain Writing Act of 2010.

12. **Provide Multilingual Support**: Depending on user needs and agency mission, provide critical content in multiple languages to accommodate non-English speakers.

13. **Standardize User Interface**: Utilize the U.S. Web Design System to ensure a consistent look and feel across digital services, enhancing user experience and brand consistency.

14. **Monitor and Update Regularly**: Establish an ongoing review process for digital services to adapt to new requirements, address security issues swiftly, and incorporate user feedback continuously.

Organizing and documenting these actions in a project plan will help guide the client through the compliance process and ensure successful delivery of the project while adheriting to government standards and regulations.
