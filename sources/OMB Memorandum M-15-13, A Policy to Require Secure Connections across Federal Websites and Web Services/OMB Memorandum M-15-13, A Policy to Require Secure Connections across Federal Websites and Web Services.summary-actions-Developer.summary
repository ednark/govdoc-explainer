To show compliance with the specified government standards for secure connections across federal websites and web services, as a developer specializing in Drupal, you should take the following actions:

1. **Enforce HTTPS on All Public Websites and Services**: Ensure all publicly accessible federal websites and web services under your management are served exclusively over HTTPS to protect the privacy and integrity of the connection. This includes setting up HTTPS in your Drupal configuration and server settings.

2. **Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Configure HSTS on your Drupal site to force browsers to use HTTPS connections exclusively. This involves setting HSTS headers that instruct browsers to only interact with your website using a secure connection.

3. **Acquire and Manage SSL/TLS Certificates**: Obtain SSL/TLS certificates from a reputable certificate authority for every domain and subdomain. Ensure these certificates are correctly installed and configured on your server to authenticate and encrypt the website connections.

4. **Handle Mixed Content Appropriately**: Review your Drupal site to ensure that all external resources (like images, scripts, and stylesheets) are loaded over HTTPS. Replace or update any external links that load content over HTTP.

5. **Evaluate and Update API Security**: If your Drupal site interacts with APIs, ensure they are also served over HTTPS to protect data in transit. Modify API endpoints and client configurations as necessary to support secure connections.

6. **Plan for Regular Updates and Compliance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor and update the security configurations of your Drupal site, including SSL/TLS certificates, to align with evolving web standards and security practices. Use tools and resources such as [https.cio.gov](https://https.cio.gov) for best practices and technical assistance.

7. **Optimize Performance Taking Encryption Overhead into Account**: While implementing HTTPS, consider server performance impacts. Utilize modern protocols like SPDY or HTTP/2 if supported, to improve latency and server response times.

By focusing on these key areas in your Drupal implementation, you can comply with the government standards for secure connections, providing a safer and more reliable web experience for users.
