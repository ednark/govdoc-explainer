### Summary of Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements from M-15-13 Memorandum

#### Security
- **HTTPS Requirement**: All publicly accessible Federal websites and services must operate only under HTTPS to ensure secure and private connections.
- **Certificate Authorities**: Browsers must trust certificates that authenticate websites and prevent masquerading by untrusted sites.
- **Server Name Indication (SNI)**: This extension to TLS improves IP address efficiency but may not be supported by some older clients.
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforce HSTS to make browsers assume HTTPS usage henceforth, minimizing insecure redirects.
- **Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)**: While not covered in this memorandum, prior guidance encourages the use of DNSSEC for added security.

#### Accessibility
- **Secure Connections**: Implement HTTPS to ensure data privacy and integrity, making websites universally accessible through secure means.

#### User Experience
- **Consistent Secure Access**: Mandating HTTPS enhances user trust by providing consistent, reliable, and secure browsing experiences.

#### Compliance
- **Timeline for Implementation**:
  - New Federal websites must comply upon launch.
  - Existing sites should migrate based on a risk-based priority by December 31, 2016.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: A dashboard at `https://pulse.cio.gov` tracks agency adherence to these standards.

#### Compact Summary
- All Federal public websites and services must use HTTPS for security and user trust.
- Certificates should authenticate site identities, while SNI and HSTS further enhance security.
- Compliance is monitored online, with a firm deadline set for all existing websites to migrate to HTTPS by the end of 2016.

This summary pinpoints the core directives related to security, accessibility, user experience, and compliance as stipulated in the M-15-13 memorandum, guiding Federal agencies towards full HTTPS implementation.
