### Document Summary for Designers Specializing in Human-Centered Design

#### Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

1. **HTTPS Mandate**
   - All publicly accessible Federal websites and web services must utilize HTTPS to ensure secure connections.
   - HTTPS verifies website identity, encrypts user and website interaction, and guards against data interception and manipulation.

2. **Compliance Deadlines**
   - New Federal websites must comply with the HTTPS policy upon launch.
   - Existing Federal websites must migrate to HTTPS-only, incorporating HSTS by December 31, 2016.

3. **Security Protocols**
   - Implementation of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is required to force browsers to use HTTPS and protect against downgrade attacks.
   - Domains with HSTS should be added to a preload list to ensure HTTPS enforcement.

#### Focus Areas from the Document
- **Security**: HTTPS ensures a secure connection, preventing data interception and ensuring data integrity. HTTPS does not protect against all forms of cyber threats but secures data in transit between the user and the website.
- **User Experience**: Encrypted interactions secure user data, enhancing trust and safety during web browsing.
- **Accessibility**: The document stresses that secure connections should support all external resources like images and scripts, ensuring a cohesive and secure user environment.
- **Compliance**: Guidelines for immediate and phased implementation of HTTPS stress timely adherence, with monitoring through public dashboards and technical assistance provided via dedicated government websites.

#### Simplified Summary
- **HTTPS Use**: Mandatory for all Federal public web interfaces to ensure secure user interactions.
- **Implementation Deadline**: All existing services must transition to HTTPS-only by the end of 2016.
- **Security Measures**: Adopt HSTS to enhance security, with all secure domains added to browser preload lists.
- **User Assurance**: Secure protocols contribute to a safer and more reliable user experience across federal digital platforms.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Compliance is tracked and aided through governmental technical resources.
