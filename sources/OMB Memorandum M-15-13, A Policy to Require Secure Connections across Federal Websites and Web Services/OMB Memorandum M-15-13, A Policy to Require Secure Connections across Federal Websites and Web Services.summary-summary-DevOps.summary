**Document Summary: Government Standards on Web Security and Compliance**

**Primary Standards and Guidelines:**

1. **HTTPS-Only Requirement**: All publicly accessible federal websites and web services must serve content through HTTPS to ensure secure connections that protect the integrity and privacy of user data.

2. **Implementation Deadlines**:
   - New websites and services must comply with the HTTPS-only policy from launch.
   - Existing websites and services must transition to HTTPS-only by December 31, 2016.

3. **Security Protocols**:
   - Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS connections and reduce insecure redirects.
   - Consider the use of Server Name Indication (SNI) for efficient IP address utilization.
   - Implement Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) alongside HTTPS to ensure the authenticity of the DNS data.

4. **Mixed Content Management**:
   - Transition all external resources (images, scripts, fonts, etc.) to be loaded over HTTPS to prevent security risks associated with mixed content.

5. **Compliance Monitoring**:
   - Use the public dashboard at `https://pulse.cio.gov` to monitor agency compliance with the HTTPS-only mandate.

**Focused Sections:**

- **Security**: HTTPS, HSTS, SNI, DNSSEC, and mixed content handling are crucial for protecting user data and ensuring the authenticity and integrity of communications.

- **Accessibility and User Experience**: Compliance with HTTPS ensures that all users have a secure and consistent experience across federal websites, avoiding the risks associated with unencrypted HTTP.

- **Compliance**: Strict deadlines for new and existing websites, along with monitoring through a public dashboard, ensure adherence to government standards.

**Condensed Summary:**

All new and existing federal websites must utilize HTTPS-only by specific deadlines to ensure secure, private, and consistent user experiences. Key security measures include enforcing HSTS, managing mixed content, and potentially implementing SNI and DNSSEC. Compliance is monitored through a designated public dashboard.
