To ensure compliance with the government standards for secure web applications, as a Designer focusing on Human-Centered Design, User Experience (UX), and User Interface (UI), you should incorporate the following actions into your project:

1. **HTTPS Implementation**: Ensure that every part of the web application, including all user interfaces, is served over HTTPS. This protects the integrity of your website by securing the communication between the user's browser and the web application.

2. **Secure External Resources**: Verify that all external resources such as images, fonts, scripts, and stylesheet files are loaded over HTTPS to prevent mixed content issues. This is crucial for maintaining user trust and the security of user sessions.

3. **UI Design for Secure Redirects**: Design the user interfaces in such a way that HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS. This practice ensures that users are always operating under a secure connection, even if they enter or follow an HTTP link.

4. **Incorporate Visual Indicators**: Integrate clear visual indicators in the UI to show connection security (such as padlock icons or color-coded address bars) that reinforce the security of the userâ€™s interaction with the application.

5. **User Accessibility and Experience**: Maintain a focus on accessibility and user experience in the design of secure interactions. For instance, ensure that any security warnings or HTTPS-related notifications are comprehensible and user-friendly.

6. **Responsive Design and Testing**: Ensure that the secure, HTTPS-enabled website is thoroughly tested across various devices and platforms to maintain an optimal user experience. Responsive design principles should be adhered to, ensuring that security and usability are maintained across different devices.

By implementing these key actions, you will be addressing the essential user experience and interface components necessary for compliance with government standards focusing on secure web application development.
