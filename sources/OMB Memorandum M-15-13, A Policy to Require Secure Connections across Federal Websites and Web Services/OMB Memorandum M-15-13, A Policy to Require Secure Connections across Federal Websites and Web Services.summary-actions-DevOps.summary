1. **Implement HTTPS:** Ensure that every federal website and web service is accessible solely via HTTPS to provide a secure, encrypted connection. This includes obtaining and configuring SSL/TLS certificates for each domain and service.

2. **Enable HSTS:** Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force browsers to use secure connections, thereby reducing the risk of downgrade attacks and user exposure to additional threats. Specify a HSTS header with a minimum max-age of one year.

3. **Update Existing Services:** Prioritize and convert all existing web services and websites to HTTPS. This includes modifying any existing resources to be loaded securely (images, scripts, iframes).

4. **Manage Certificates:** Set up processes for the acquisition, renewal, and proper management of SSL/TAPS certificates to prevent expiration or security lapses.

5. **Secure Web APIs:** For services primarily accessed via web APIs, ensure HTTPS is implemented and consider possible adjustments for non-browser clients that must connect securely.

6. **Performance Optimization:** Adapt server configurations to support modern protocols like HTTP/2 or SPDY, which are designed to work efficiently with HTTPS. Verify implement utilizing technologies such as Server Name Indication (SNI) for better IP address utilization.

7. **Mixed Content Auditing:** Audit and modify any mixed content issues by ensuring all externally linked content on your site (such as third-party JavaScript or style sheets) is served over HTTPS.

8. **Continual Monitoring and Updating:** Keep up-to-date with the latest best practices, protocols, and security measures; regularly update your HTTPS configurations, including ciphers and TLS versions, to maintain high-security standards.

9. **Establish Redirections:** Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirections (making sure all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS) and confirm that HSTS headers are set appropriately on these responses.

10. **Technical Support and Resources:** Utilize online resources provided by the government (such as HTTPS.cio.gov) for the latest guidance and technical support in implementing these standards effectively.

Each of these steps ensures robust security measures aligning with the governmentâ€™s HTTPS-only policy, ultimately enhancing the trust and integrity of federal web services.
