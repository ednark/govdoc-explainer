As a DevOps technician, here is a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with the standards defined in NIST Special Publication 800-44 for securing public web servers:

1. **Secure Operating System**
   - Apply all necessary OS patches and updates.
   - Disable unnecessary services and applications.
   - Configure user authentication and enforce strong password policies.

2. **Secure Web Server Software**
   - Install web server software on a dedicated host.
   - Apply necessary patches or upgrades to the web server software.
   - Remove or disable unnecessary default services and login accounts.
   - Configure HTTP service bans to not report detailed server information.

3. **Configure Network Protections**
   - Place the web server within a DMZ.
   - Implement firewall rules to block all unnecessary traffic, including blocking all inbound traffic except necessary HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
   - Implement network-based and host-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS).

4. **Implement Access Controls**
   - Configure minimal user privileges for web server processes.
   - Create a dedicated disk partition for web content, separate from the OS.
   - Use secure protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTPS) for remote administration and content updates.
   
5. **Enable Logging and Monitoring**
   - Turn on and configure web server logs to capture detailed access and error logs.
   - Store logs on a centralized logging server to ensure they cannot be tampered with.
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activity and implement automated log analysis tools.

6. **Web Content and Application Security**
   - Ensure regular vulnerability scans on the web server and applications.
   - Validate all user inputs within web applications to avoid issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - Regularly update and patch all web applications, frameworks, and plugins.

7. **SSL/TLS Implementation**
   - Implement SSL/TLS for securing data transmission.
   - Use certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   - Monitor SSL/TLS certificates and configure to use strong cipher suites only. 

8. **Regular Security Tests**
   - Schedule and perform regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
   - Document and remediate identified vulnerabilities promptly. 

9. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Implement regular backups for both data and OS, using differential or incremental backups regularly.
   - Maintain a separate, secure, and authoritative copy of web content.

Following this minimal checklist will help ensure that your web infrastructure adheres to critical security and compliance guidelines as per NIST Special Publication 800-44.
