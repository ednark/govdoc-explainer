To show compliance with standards for a web application, a Drupal developer should focus on the following minimal list of actions:

1. **Choose Secure Versions**:
   - Use the latest stable version of Drupal core.
   - Regularly update contributed modules and themes.

2. **Secure Installation**:
   - Apply all security patches to the OS and web server software.
   - Restrict file permissions to the minimal necessary.

3. **User Authentication**:
   - Use Drupal's built-in user authentication mechanisms.
   - Enforce strong password policies.

4. **Access Controls**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit privileges.
   - Use fine-grained permissions for different user roles.

5. **Secure Configuration**:
   - Disable unnecessary modules and services.
   - Restrict access to critical files like `settings.php`.

6. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - Use Drupal's API to validate and sanitize all user inputs.
   - Avoid executing raw SQL queries; use Drupal's database API.

7. **Implement HTTPS**:
   - Configure the web server to use SSL/TLS for all pages.
   - Ensure certificates are valid and correctly installed.

8. **Session Management**:
   - Regenerate session IDs on account login.
   - Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for session data.

9. **Monitor and Log**:
   - Enable Drupalâ€™s logging functions (dblog or syslog).
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activities.

10. **Backup Regularly**:
    - Set up automated backups of the database and files.
    - Store backups securely offsite.

11. **Secure Active Content**:
    - Validate and sanitize all dynamic content.
    - Ensure secure implementation of JavaScript and other client-side scripts.

12. **Regular Security Audits**:
    - Perform periodic vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
    - Address identified vulnerabilities promptly.

13. **Content Security**:
    - Implement Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention techniques.
    - Avoid exposing sensitive data in URLs.

By following these steps, a Drupal developer can ensure that their implementation meets essential security standards as prescribed by NIST SP 800-44 and related guidelines.
