To demonstrate compliance with government standards for securing web servers from a project management perspective, track and organize the following actions:

1. **Plan and Document Security Requirements**
   - Identify and document security requirements for information stored, processed, or transmitted.

2. **System Security Plan**
   - Develop a comprehensive system security plan.

3. **Secure Installation and Patch Management**
   - Ensure all systems are patched and updated.
   - Verify removal or disabling of unnecessary services and applications.

4. **Access Controls**
   - Configure and enforce access controls for users and administrators.
   - Ensure secure configuration of operating system and web server application permissions.

5. **Authentication Mechanisms**
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms for accessing the web server.
   - Use SSL/TLS for encrypting sensitive information during transmission.

6. **Firewall and Network Configuration**
   - Set up firewalls to control and monitor traffic between the internet and web server.
   - Configure network elements such as routers and switches for enhanced security.

7. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**
   - Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor and protect the web server.
   - Ensure frequent updates to IDPS signatures.

8. **Web Content Security**
   - Conduct periodic reviews of web content for sensitive information.
   - Implement security measures for publishing procedures and content validation.

9. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Enable comprehensive logging of web server activities and review logs regularly.
   - Protect log files from unauthorized access.

10. **Regular Security Testing**
    - Perform regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
    - Address and document any identified vulnerabilities immediately.

11. **Backup and Recovery**
    - Implement regular backup procedures for web server data.
    - Maintain and protect an authoritative copy of web content.

12. **Incident Response and Reporting**
    - Develop and enforce policies and procedures for responding to security incidents.
    - Ensure timely reporting and management of any security breaches.

13. **User and Administrator Training**
    - Conduct security training for all users and administrators involved in the web application.

By tracking these actions, the project manager can guide the client in completing tasks that ensure compliance with Special Publication 800-44 guidelines for securing public web servers.
