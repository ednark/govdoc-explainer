Certainly! Here's a list tailored for a Drupal developer responsible for implementing backend business logic to ensure compliance with the government IPv6 standards:

1. **Validate IPv6 Compatibility:**
   - Ensure that Drupal core and any custom modules can handle IPv6 addresses.

2. **IPv6-Enabled Hosting:**
   - Verify that the web hosting environment supports IPv6.

3. **Upgrade Network Interfaces:**
   - Confirm that all network interfaces are IPv6-enabled.

4. **Update APIs and Services:**
   - Ensure all third-party APIs and services used by the application support IPv6.

5. **Database Configuration:**
   - Verify database configurations to store and manage IPv6 addresses.

6. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Ensure DNS settings include AAAA records for IPv6.

7. **Security Configuration:**
   - Update security measures to handle IPv6 traffic (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS).

8. **Testing:**
   - Conduct comprehensive tests to confirm the application functions correctly over IPv6.

By focusing on these areas, a Drupal developer can help ensure the web application meets the government standards for IPv6 compliance.
