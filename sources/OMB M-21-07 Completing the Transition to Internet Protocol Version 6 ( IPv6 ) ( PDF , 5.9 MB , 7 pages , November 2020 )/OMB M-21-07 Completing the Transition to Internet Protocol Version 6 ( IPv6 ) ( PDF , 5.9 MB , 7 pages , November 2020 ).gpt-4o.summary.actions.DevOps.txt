For a DevOps technician working on a web application, the following minimal list of actions should be taken to ensure compliance with the government standards for transitioning to IPv6:

1. **Integrate IPv6:** Ensure that all hosted web applications are capable of operating natively on IPv6.
2. **IPv6 Access:** Verify that public/external facing servers and services like web, email, and DNS are accessible via IPv6.
3. **Network Configuration:** Configure network devices (routers, switches) to support IPv6 and ensure proper routing.
4. **Security Systems:** Ensure firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and other security appliances support and enforce IPv6 traffic rules.
5. **Monitoring Tools:** Update or deploy monitoring tools to track IPv6 traffic and performance.
6. **Load Balancers:** Configure load balancers to handle IPv6 traffic properly.
7. **Testing:** Conduct periodic testing to ensure the infrastructure operates seamlessly in an IPv6-only environment.
8. **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation on infrastructure configurations and IPv6 compliance steps.
9. **Pilot Projects:** Implement at least one IPv6-only pilot project to demonstrate capability and gather practical insights.
10. **Update Deployment Pipelines:** Ensure CI/CD pipelines support and validate IPv6 configurations before deployment.

By completing these actions, a DevOps technician can help ensure that the web application's infrastructure meets the necessary IPv6 compliance requirements.
