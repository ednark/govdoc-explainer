For a Designer specializing in Human-Centered Design (HCD) responsible for the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) of a web application, a minimal list of actions to show compliance with IPv6 transition standards includes:

1. **Ensure IPv6 compatibility**: Confirm that the UI and UX designs are functional and visually consistent when accessed via IPv6.

2. **Test Accessibility**: Verify accessibility features in the design, ensuring they work seamlessly over IPv6 connections.

3. **Check responsiveness**: Make sure that the application's responsiveness is maintained on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

4. **Update resource links**: Ensure all links and resources (e.g., images, CSS files) are accessible over IPv6.

5. **Monitor performance**: Assess and confirm that load times and performance metrics are within acceptable ranges for IPv6 users.

6. **User feedback**: Collect user feedback specifically addressing experience differences between IPv4 and IPv6 users, if any.

By following these steps, the Designer can ensure the web application provides a consistent and positive user experience across both network protocols.
