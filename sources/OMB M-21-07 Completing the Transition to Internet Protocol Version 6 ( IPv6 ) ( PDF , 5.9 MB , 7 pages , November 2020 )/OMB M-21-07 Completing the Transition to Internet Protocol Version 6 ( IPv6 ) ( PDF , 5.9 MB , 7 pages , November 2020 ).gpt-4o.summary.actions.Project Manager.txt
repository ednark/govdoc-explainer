Sure, here are the minimal actions a project manager needs to take to show compliance with the IPv6 standards for a web application:

1. **Form Project Team:** 
   - Designate team members for IPv6 integration (acquisition, policy, technical).

2. **Set IPv6 Policy:**
   - Establish and publish an IPv6 policy within 180 days.

3. **Upgrade to IPv6:**
   - Ensure all new systems are IPv6-enabled by FY 2023.
   - Upgrade public/external-facing servers and services (web, email, DNS, etc.) to use native IPv6.

4. **Pilot IPv6-Only System:**
   - Complete at least one pilot of an IPv6-only operational system by the end of FY 2021 and report results.

5. **Develop and Update Implementation Plan:**
   - Create an IPv6 implementation plan by the end of FY 2021.
   - Ensure 20% IPv6-only IP-enabled assets by end of FY 2023.
   - Ensure 50% IPv6-only IP-enabled assets by end of FY 2024.
   - Ensure 80% IPv6-only IP-enabled assets by end of FY 2025.
   - Identify and plan migration or retirement for non-convertible systems.

6. **Vendor Compliance:**
   - Require vendors to be compliant with the USGv6 Test Program for hardware and software.

7. **Coordinate Security:**
   - Make sure IT security plans include IPv6.
   - Ensure network operations and security services are IPv6-capable.

8. **Client Communication:**
   - Work with external partners to transition their systems interfacing with federal systems to IPv6.

Tracking and managing these actions will ensure the web application project complies with the specified government standards for IPv6.
