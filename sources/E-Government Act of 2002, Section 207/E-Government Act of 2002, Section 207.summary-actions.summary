To ensure compliance with the standards set out in the E-Government Act of 2002 and its related frameworks, while developing and hosting web applications, your application development project should typically include the following actions:

1. **Enhance Citizen Access**: Design the application to improve ease of access to government information and services. Ensure that relevant content is available and easily navigable.

2. **Ensure Security and Privacy**: Implement measures that meet federal standards for information security to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. Adhere to privacy standards to protect personal information (as outlined in Sec. 208 of the E-Government Act).

3. **Accessibility for All Users**: Comply with accessibility standards under Sec. 508 of the Rehabilitation Act to ensure that the web application is usable by people with disabilities.

4. **Use of Federal Enterprise Architecture**: Develop and deploy the web application in accordance with the prescribed Federal Enterprise Architecture. This helps in integrating and managing complex IT environments.

5. **Promote Electronic Signatures**: Where applicable, integrate methods for the use of electronic signatures to facilitate secure online transactions (Sec. 203).

6. **Interoperability and Compatibility**: Design systems that are compatible and can operate interactively with other products or systems without restricted access or implementation (Sec. 216 on Common Protocols).

7. **Protect Confidential Information**: Comply with requirements regarding the protection and confidentiality of statistical and nonstatistical data collected or used (Title V of the Act).

8. **Regular Testing and Updates**: Regularly test the web application for security vulnerabilities and update it in compliance with ongoing federal, state, and local standards.

9. **Information Sharing and Integration**: Facilitate the effective sharing and integration of information across various governmental platforms, maintaining proper security and confidentiality protocols.

10. **Documentation and Reporting**: Keep detailed documentation of compliance practices and periodically report on these practices as required by oversight bodies or agencies.

11. **Public Collaboration and Feedback**: Include mechanisms to receive and incorporate public feedback to continuously improve the accessibility and usability of the application.

By adhering to these summarized actions, your application project will align with federal standards and contribute to a secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital government environment.
