To show compliance with the E-Government Act of 2002 as a DevOps technician focused on designing and managing infrastructure for web applications, you must:

1. **Secure Information System Development**: Implement security measures in the development and maintenance of the web application and its infrastructure. Ensure that security is integrated into the application lifecycle from the design phase to deployment and maintenance.

2. **Implement Information Security Standards**: Adhere to federal information security standards such as those recommended by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) section of the E-Government Act.

3. **Manage Access Controls**: Enforce secure authentication and authorization practices for access to the web application and the data it processes. Apply the least privilege principle to minimize access rights for users and administrators to the bare minimum necessary for their roles.

4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive information transmitted by the web application using robust encryption methods to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Secure data both in transit and at rest.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Remediation**: Conduct periodic security assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures. Implement remediation actions swiftly to address any identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

6. **Implement Privacy Protections**: Comply with privacy provisions detailed in the E-Government Act to protect personally identifiable information (PII). Include clear privacy policies pertaining to user data and ensure they are strictly followed.

7. **Ensure Continuous Monitoring**: Set up systems for continuous monitoring of the web application and infrastructure to detect, alert, and respond to security incidents and abnormal activities.

8. **Disaster Recovery Planning**: Establish and maintain a comprehensive disaster recovery plan. Ensure you have backups and failover mechanisms in place to guarantee data availability and application functionality in case of a disaster or failure.

9. **Documentation and Compliance Reporting**: Maintain thorough documentation of compliance efforts, security policies, and operational procedures. Prepare for compliance reporting to relevant authorities as required.

10. **User Training and Awareness**: Conduct regular training sessions for users and staff about security best practices, threat awareness, and regulatory compliance related to the use of the web application.

These steps will help demonstrate compliance with applicable government standards and ensure the security and reliability of the web applications.
