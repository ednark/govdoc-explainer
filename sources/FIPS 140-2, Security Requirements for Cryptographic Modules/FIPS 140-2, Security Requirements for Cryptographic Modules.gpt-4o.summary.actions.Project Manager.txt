To ensure compliance with FIPS 140-2 standards for a web application, the project manager should track and organize the following key actions:

1. **Cryptographic Module Selection**:
   - Choose cryptographic modules that are FIPS 140-2 certified.

2. **Documentation Review**:
   - Ensure that all documentation specifies the use of FIPS 140-2 compliant modules.

3. **Security Specification**:
   - Document the security requirements, including detailed specifications of cryptographic functions.

4. **Roles and Authentication**:
   - Define and document roles, services, and authentication mechanisms to meet FIPS 140-2 requirements.

5. **Finite State Model**:
   - Develop and document a finite state model for the cryptographic module indicating the states and transitions.

6. **Physical Security**:
   - Implement and document physical security measures appropriate for the level of FIPS 140-2 compliance.

7. **Operational Environment**:
   - Document and ensure the operational environment meets FIPS standards, including secure installation procedures.

8. **Key Management**:
   - Develop and document cryptographic key management processes, including generation, distribution, and destruction.

9. **EMI/EMC Compliance**:
   - Verify and document that the module meets Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI/EMC) requirements.

10. **Self-Tests**:
    - Implement and document routine self-tests as specified by FIPS 140-2.

11. **Design Assurance**:
    - Verify and document the design assurance processes to ensure the module meets security requirements throughout its lifecycle.

12. **Attack Mitigation**:
    - Document and implement measures to mitigate specific attacks identified in FIPS 140-2.

13. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Ensure the cryptographic module undergoes testing and validation against FIPS 140-2 requirements before deployment.

14. **Compliance Documentation**:
    - Maintain comprehensive records of all compliance activities and retain certifications and reports proving FIPS 140-2 compliance.

By keeping track of these actions, the project manager will be able to guide the project towards successful FIPS 140-2 compliance.
