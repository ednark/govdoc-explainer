To ensure compliance with FIPS 140-2 standards from the perspective of a Drupal developer implementing backend business logic, you should take the following actions:

1. **Use Approved Cryptographic Libraries**:
   - Ensure all cryptographic functions are implemented using libraries/modules that are FIPS 140-2 certified.
   
2. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**:
   - Ensure all sensitive data (e.g., user passwords, financial information) is encrypted using FIPS-approved encryption methods.
   
3. **Implement Secure Key Management**:
   - Use secure key management practices for generating, storing, and accessing encryption keys. Ensure the keys are appropriately rotated and disposed of.
   
4. **Enforce Robust Authentication Mechanisms**:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and ensure roles and access controls are managed securely.
   
5. **Configure EMI/EMC Protections**:
   - Verify that the hardware and software configurations mitigate Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) issues.
   
6. **Conduct Regular Self-tests**:
   - Integrate automated self-tests to detect and prevent any security vulnerabilities or failures in cryptographic functionalities.
   
7. **Follow Secure Design Principles**:
   - Ensure that the design adheres to best practices in security, including input validation, output encoding, and secure error handling.
   
8. **Document Compliance Measures**:
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation outlining how the application meets FIPS 140-2 requirements, including decisions made and testing outcomes.
   
9. **Ensure Physical Security Measures**:
   - If applicable, ensure physical security measures are in place for any servers or hardware managing cryptographic modules.
   
10. **Review and Update Regularly**:
    - Continuously review and update the application to maintain compliance with any updates or changes to FIPS standards, moving towards FIPS 140-3 as necessary. 

These steps should help you ensure compliance with FIPS 140-2 standards while developing backend business logic for a web application.
