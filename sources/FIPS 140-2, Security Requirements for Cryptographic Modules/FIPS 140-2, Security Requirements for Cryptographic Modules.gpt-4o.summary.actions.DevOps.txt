For a DevOps technician to ensure compliance with FIPS 140-2 for a web application, here is a minimal list of actions:

1. **Verify Cryptographic Modules:**
   - Use cryptographic modules that are FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 certified.

2. **Design & Implementation:**
   - Ensure cryptographic modules are implemented according to their security specifications.

3. **Access Control:**
   - Implement role-based access control for cryptographic functions.

4. **Authentication:**
   - Ensure robust authentication mechanisms for accessing cryptographic modules.

5. **Key Management:**
   - Use approved key management techniques for generating, storing, and destroying cryptographic keys.

6. **Physical Security:**
   - Implement physical security measures to protect cryptographic hardware.

7. **Environmental & Electromagnetic Controls:**
   - Address EMI/EMC requirements to prevent information leakage.

8. **Self-Tests:**
   - Regularly perform self-tests on cryptographic modules to ensure they operate correctly.

9. **Finetune Workflow:**
   - Ensure workflows align with secure practices and mitigation measures.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Maintain detailed documentation of compliance-related configurations and testing outcomes.

By following these actions, a DevOps technician can help ensure that the web application's infrastructure complies with FIPS 140-2 standards.
