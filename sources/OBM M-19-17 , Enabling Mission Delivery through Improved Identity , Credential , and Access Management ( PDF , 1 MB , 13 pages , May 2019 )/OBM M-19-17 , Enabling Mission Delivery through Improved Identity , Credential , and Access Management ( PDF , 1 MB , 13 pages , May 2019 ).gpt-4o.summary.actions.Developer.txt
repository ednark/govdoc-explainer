1. **Identity Proofing:**
   - Implement identity proofing processes using NIST SP 800-63 guidelines.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Integrate authentication mechanisms that comply with FIPS 201 standards.
   - Enable PIV (Personal Identity Verification) credential authentication.

3. **Access Control:**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanisms.
   - Set up functionalities to revoke access privileges promptly when no longer authorized.

4. **Digital Signatures:**
   - Incorporate the use of PIV credential digital signatures for transactions requiring authentication.

5. **Privacy and Security:**
   - Ensure user data protection in compliance with privacy requirements, limiting the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to that which is legally authorized and necessary.
   - Implement appropriate encryption mechanisms for data in transit.

6. **Federation Support:**
   - Implement support for federated identity management to accept identity and authentication assertions from other agencies and partners.

7. **API Integration:**
   - Use open APIs and commercial standards for identity management and transactions.
   - Ensure APIs for cross-agency identity verification and data sharing comply with privacy and security standards.

8. **Credential Lifecycle Management:**
   - Establish mechanisms to manage the lifecycle of digital identities, including binding, updating, revoking, and destroying credentials as required.

9. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Implement monitoring tools for continuous evaluation and management of access and credentials.

10. **Compliance Documentation:**
    - Maintain documentation of compliance with ICAM policies and NIST guidelines, including audit trails for identity proofing and access transactions.
