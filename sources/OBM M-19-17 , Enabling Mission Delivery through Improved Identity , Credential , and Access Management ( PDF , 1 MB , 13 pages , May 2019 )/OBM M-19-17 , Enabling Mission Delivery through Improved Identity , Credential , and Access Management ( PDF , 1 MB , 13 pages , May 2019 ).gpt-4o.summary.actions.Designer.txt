For compliance with the standards from a Human-Centered Design (HCD) perspective in terms of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI):

1. **Accessible Design:** Ensure the application meets accessibility standards to accommodate users with disabilities, as per Section 508 compliance (align with NIST SP 800-63 guidelines).

2. **Privacy Notice Placement:** Clearly display privacy notices and consent forms, particularly when collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Users should easily understand how their data will be used.

3. **User Identity Verification:** Implement user-friendly identity verification processes that comply with NIST SP 800-63 guidelines, ensuring they are straightforward and secure.

4. **User Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide interfaces for users to give feedback on identity verification processes and overall experience. This helps align with continuous improvement as indicated by government standards.

5. **Data Minimization:** Design forms and interactions to collect only the PII necessary for the transaction, ensuring users understand why each piece of data is needed.

6. **Secure Authentication UI:** Ensure that sign-in and authentication processes are intuitive, clear, and compliant with FIPS 201 standards for secure authentication.

7. **Multiple Authentication Options:** Provide options for users to link and authenticate with different credentials that meet security standards, enhancing convenience and security.

8. **Information Encryption:** Clearly indicate to users that sensitive communications (e.g., entering a password) are encrypted, aligning with PIV credential usage for secure transit.

9. **Error Handling and User Guidance:** Design clear error messages and user guidance to help users correct any issues during identity proofing or authentication.

10. **Regular Reviews and Updates:** Collaborate with the development team to ensure the UI/UX aligns with the latest security and privacy guidelines as updated by standards bodies like NIST.

By adhering to these action items, the Designer ensures that the user experience of a web application meets the necessary compliance standards from a Human-Centered Design perspective.
