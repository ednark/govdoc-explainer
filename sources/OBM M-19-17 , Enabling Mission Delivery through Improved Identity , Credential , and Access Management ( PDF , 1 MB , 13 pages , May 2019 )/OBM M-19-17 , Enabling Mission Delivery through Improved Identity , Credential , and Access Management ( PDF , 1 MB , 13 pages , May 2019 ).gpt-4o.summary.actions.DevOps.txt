For a DevOps technician, the following minimal list of actions should be undertaken to ensure compliance with the standards outlined in the Government Standards Document:

1. **Identity Proofing**: Implement identity proofing aligned with NIST SP 800-63-3 guidelines.
2. **PIV Credentials**: Use Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials for authentication where applicable.
3. **Access Control**: 
   - Use derived PIV credentials for authentication on applications and devices.
   - Ensure secure access control mechanisms are in place, including the ability to revoke access when necessary.
4. **Digital Signatures**: Use PIV credentials for digital signature capabilities.
5. **Encryption**: Implement encryption for transmitting and storing sensitive data.
6. **Federated Identity**: Accept and leverage federated identity solutions for cross-agency authentication.
7. **Authentication**: Utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to meet security requirements.
8. **API Standards**: Ensure APIs adhere to open commercial standards for interoperability.
9. **Continuous Monitoring**: Deploy tools from the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program for ongoing security monitoring.
10. **PII Protection**: Ensure the collection, storage, and transmission of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) adhere to privacy best practices and are legally compliant.
11. **Documentation and Feedback**: Document processes and provide feedback on implementation experiences to relevant councils and NIST for improvements.
12. **Compliance Checks**: Regularly review and update systems to remain compliant with the latest NIST, GSA, and federal guidelines.

By following these actions, a DevOps technician can help ensure the web application's infrastructure complies with relevant government standards.
