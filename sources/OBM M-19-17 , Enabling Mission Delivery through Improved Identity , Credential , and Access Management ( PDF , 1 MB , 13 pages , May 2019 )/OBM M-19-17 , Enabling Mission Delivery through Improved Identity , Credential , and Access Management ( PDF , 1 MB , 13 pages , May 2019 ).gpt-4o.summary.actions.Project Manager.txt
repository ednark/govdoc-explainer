Certainly! Here are the minimal actions a project manager should take to show compliance with the government standards for a web application:

1. **Identity Proofing**: Ensure identity proofing aligns with NIST SP 800-63 guidelines.
2. **Credential Issuance**: Issue and manage credentials in accordance with HSPD-12 and FIPS 201-2.
3. **Access Control**: Implement and monitor access control mechanisms.
4. **PII Collection Limits**: Limit the collection and protection of PII as per guidelines.
5. **Federated Identity**: Use or accept federated identity solutions that meet NIST guidelines.
6. **Digital Interactions**: Ensure safe digital interactions with the public.
7. **Risk Management**: Incorporate digital identity risk management practices.
8. **PIV Usage**: Use PIV credentials for authentication and encryption as required.
9. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement tools for continuous diagnostics and mitigation.
10. **Shared Services**: Leverage federally provided or commercially provided shared services.
11. **Compliance with Contracts**: Ensure contractors comply with HSPD-12 and relevant acquisition regulations.
12. **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate feedback from users to continuously improve identity and access processes.

Tracking these key actions should keep the project on the path to compliance.
