To ensure compliance with the Plain Writing Mesa of 2010 for a web application project, here’s a minimal action list tailored for a project manager:

1. **Review the Plain Writing Act of 2010**: Familiarize yourself with the act to understand the core requirements of plain language in government communications.

2. **Incorporate Plain Language Guidelines**: Integrate the Federal Plain Language Guidelines into the project’s documentation standards. Ensure all team members have access to these guidelines.

3. **Training and Resources**: Organize training sessions for the team on plain language principles. Provide resources such as the "Plain Language Web Writing Tips" for reference.

4. **Document Review Process**: Establish a review process to ensure all public-facing documents, including web content, adhere to plain writing standards. This could involve regular audits or peer reviews.

5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism on the application to gather user insights on the clarity of information provided. Use this data to make continuous improvements.

6. **Reporting Compliance**: Keep a record of compliance efforts and improvements made in adherence to the Plain Writing Act. Prepare reports for both internal use and client review to demonstrate compliance.

7. **Client Collaboration**: Engage with the client regularly to ensure their requirements are met in compliance with the plain language standards, and adjust the project’s communication strategies accordingly.

By following these steps, you will help ensure that the web application meets the government's standards for plain writing, making information accessible and understandable for all users.
