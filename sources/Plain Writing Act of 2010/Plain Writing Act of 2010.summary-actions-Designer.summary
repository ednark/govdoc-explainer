To ensure compliance with the Plain Writing Act of 2010 from a Designer's perspective focused on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) in developing government-related web applications, here is a list of minimal actions to include in your project:

1. **Use Clear Language:**
   Design content to be straightforward and easy to understand. Prioritize simplicity in word choice and sentence structure based on the guidelines from the Plain Writing Act of 2010.

2. **Organize Information Effectively:**
   Arrange content in a logical flow. Use headings, lists, and spacing to break text into manageable sections, making it easier for users to find information quickly and understand it.

3. **Ensure Readability:**
   Opt for fonts, sizes, and colors that enhance readability. Text should be accessible to users with varying sight abilities and should be readable on different devices and screens.

4. **Incorporate User Feedback:**
   Implement mechanisms for collecting user feedback specifically about the clarity of the information provided. Use this feedback to make iterative improvements to content and design.

5. **Create Intuitive Navigation:**
   Design a user interface that allows users to navigate through the application effortlessly. Clearly label sections and links to ensure users always know their location and how to access desired information.

6. **Accessibility Compliance:**
   Ensure that all design elements meet the accessibility requirements under Section 508, which complements the requirement for clear communication by making the application usable for all, including those with disabilities.

7. **Regularly Update Content:**
   Regularly review and update the content to maintain compliance with the Plain Writing Act by removing outdated information and jargon, ensuring all written material remains straightforward and accessible.

8. **Plain Language Summary:**
   Provide a plain language summary for complex content, breaking down difficult concepts into easily digestible and understandable parts.

These steps help fulfill the requirement of the Plain Writing Act of 2010 in the context of government web applications, ensuring the delivery of information is clear, concise, and usable for the public.
