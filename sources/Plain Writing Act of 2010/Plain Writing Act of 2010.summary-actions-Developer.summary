To ensure compliance with the Government's Plain Writing Act of 2010 for a web application project, particularly from the perspective of a Drupal developer implementing backend business logic, focus on the following key actions:

1. **Implement Clear Language Display Mechanisms:**
   - Develop features in Drupal that facilitate the use of plain language in content areas. This might include custom content types or fields that prompt content creators to write clearly and plainly.

2. **Ensure Readability Functions:**
   - Integrate or develop Drupal modules that assess and improve the readability of text based on recognized standards, providing feedback to content creators directly through the content management system (CMS).

3. **Content Editing Tools:**
   - Incorporate text editors that support plain writing principles, such as those with built-in readability checks or style guides specific to plain writing.

4. **Accessibility Enhancements:**
   - Adapt site themes and modules to comply with Section 508 IT Accessibility, supporting features like text-to-speech, high contrast modes, and keyboard navigability, which complement the goal of clear and plain communication.

5. **Metadata and SEO:**
   - Ensure that metadata fields (like descriptions, tags) encourage the use of plain language to improve both accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). 

6. **Continuous Compliance Monitoring:**
   - Integrate tools or develop custom functionality within Drupal to routinely check and report on the compliance of site content with plain writing guidelines. This can help maintain standards over time and through content updates.

7. **Training and Resources:**
   - Provide resources and training within the Drupal admin interface for staff on how to adhere to plain writing standards, including examples and best practices directly related to the content they are managing.

8. **User Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Implement feedback tools allowing users to report unclear content, directly contributing to continuous improvement of the web applicationâ€™s communication effectiveness.

These actions not only ensure compliance with government standards but also enhance overall user experience, making government information easier to understand and services more accessible to the public.
