To ensure compliance with the "Plain Writing Act of 2010" for a web application, a Drupal developer must focus on implementing features that adhere to clear communication standards. Here is a minimal list of actionable items:

1. **Content Review**: Ensure all content is clear, concise, and well-organized.
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure plain writing guidelines are followed for all user interfaces.
3. **Standardized Templates**: Use pre-defined, plain writing-compliant templates for all user-facing pages.
4. **User Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback form for users to comment on the clarity of content.
5. **Documentation Compliance**: Create and maintain a section on the website that informs users about plain writing standards.
6. **Training Materials**: Provide training documentation for content creators on plain writing guidelines.
7. **Content Reviews**: Schedule periodic reviews of web content to ensure ongoing compliance.

By focusing on these elements, a developer can contribute to creating a web application that meets the government's plain writing standards.
