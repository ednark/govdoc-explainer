To ensure compliance with government standards for a Drupal-based web application, a developer should:

1. **Implement Clear Navigation**: Ensure navigation menus and links are intuitive and clearly labeled for easy user access.
2. **Use Plain Language**: Incorporate text that follows plain language guidelines, making content easily understandable to the public.
3. **Make Forms Accessible**: Design and develop forms to be accessible and easy to use, following Section 508 standards.
4. **Ensure Responsive Design**: Develop the application to be fully functional and visually consistent across all devices.
5. **Optimize for Speed**: Implement best practices for performance optimization to ensure fast load times.
6. **Maintain Security Protocols**: Ensure all backend business logic follows security best practices to protect user data.
7. **Regularly Update Modules**: Keep Drupal core and modules updated to the latest versions to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
8. **Test for Accessibility**: Conduct regular accessibility testing to ensure all features comply with Section 508 requirements.
9. **Provide Clear Error Messages**: Offer user-friendly error messages that guide users to resolve issues easily.
10. **Implement Site Analytics**: Integrate site analytics to track and improve user engagement and experience.

By following these steps, a developer can effectively contribute to making the web application not only compliant with government standards but also user-friendly and secure.
