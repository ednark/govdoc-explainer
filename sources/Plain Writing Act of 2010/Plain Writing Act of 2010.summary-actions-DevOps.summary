In the context of designing and managing the infrastructure for a web application, complying with relevant government standards primarily involves ensuring content accessibility and clarity. Hereâ€™s a focused list of actions from a DevOps perspective:

1. **Implement Accessibility Features**: Adapt server configurations to support web technologies that enhance accessibility like ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels.

2. **Optimize for Readable Content Delivery**: Ensure the infrastructure supports content delivery in a format that complies with the Plain Writing Act of 2010, which might involve configuring text-based MIME types or ensuring PDF readability features are enabled server-side.

3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN) Usage**: Use CDNs to ensure fast loading times of content worldwide as readability also encompasses easy and fast access to textual information.

4. **Regular Content Updates and Management**: Automate content deployment processes from development environments to production to ensure that the changes in content adhering to plain language guidelines are updated without delays.

5. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Implement tools to monitor user engagement and feedback on the content readability and accessible features of the application, possibly integrating A/B testing tools or analytics platforms.

6. **Security and Compliance**: Regularly update and patch hosting environments, applications, and related infrastructure to secure user data and ensure privacy compliance, which indirectly supports the trust needed for dissemination of clear information.

7. **Documentation and Training**: Maintain clear and updated documentation on the infrastructure's capability to support plain language principles and provide training to the content team on these features.

These actions focus on infrastructure design to support compliance with standards related to plain language and clear communication.
