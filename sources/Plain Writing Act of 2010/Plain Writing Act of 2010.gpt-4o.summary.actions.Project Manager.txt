2. **Communicate Requirements:** Inform the team about the importance and requirements of plain writing.
3. **Training:** Schedule and conduct training sessions on plain writing techniques.
4. **Review Process:** Establish a review process for all client-facing documents to ensure plain writing is used.
5. **Update Documentation:** Ensure all user documents, forms, and instructions are updated to plain writing standards.
6. **Website Integration:** Create a plain writing section on the application's website.
