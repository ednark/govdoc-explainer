To meet compliance with the Government Standards Document, specifically the Plain Writing Act of 2010, while developing a public-facing web application, here is a minimal list of actions your team should undertake:

1. **Review and Understand Plain Writing Guidelines**: Ensure that all team members involved in content creation review and understand the Plain Language Guidelines provided by PLAIN (Plain Language Action and Information Network).

2. **Content Assessment**: Review existing application content and assess clarity, simplicity, and readability using tools like readability scores and user feedback, making sure that all information is easy to understand by the intended audience.

3. **Training**: Organize training sessions for writers and content developers focused on principles of plain writing to ensure all new content is clear and free of jargon.

4. **Use Active Voice**: Instruct content creators to predominantly use active voice, which is more direct and easier for readers to follow.

5. **Short Sentences and Paragraphs**: Develop content using short sentences and paragraphs to enhance readability and ensure messages are concise and straightforward.

6. **Common, Everyday Words**: Prioritize the use of common, everyday words over complex terminology or technical jargon unless absolutely necessary, and clarify any terminology that might be unfamiliar to the audience.

7. **User Testing**: Conduct usability testing involving diverse user groups to obtain feedback on the clarity of the content and iteratively improve based on this feedback.

8. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure all written content complies with Section 508 IT Accessibility standards to make sure it is accessible to users with disabilities, including proper use of headings, alt text for images, and accessible navigation.

9. **Regular Updates and Reviews**: Implement a schedule for regular review and updating of content to maintain plain language standards and adjust to any changes in guidelines or user needs.

10. **Document Compliance Efforts**: Keep detailed records of all plain language efforts, including training sessions, content reviews, and user testing results, to document compliance with the Plain Writing Act of 2010.

Implementing these actions will help ensure that your web application meets the requirements of the Plain Writing Act of 2010, improving user experience and accessibility of government information.
