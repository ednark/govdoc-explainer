Artificial intelligence policies
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
(Office of Origin: M/SS/CfA)
20 FAM 201.1-1
PURPOSE
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. This chapter covers Department policies to help the
Department inventory and scale the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to
support and inform the Department's mission and operations. b. Additionally, this chapter is meant to ensure that
all Department use of AI applications comply with applicable laws, regulations,
and policy, to ensure the responsible and ethical use of trustworthy AI, and to
preserve scientific integrity as described in
11 FAM 820
. c.  These policies apply to all AI use cases, as
defined below, in the Department, including those using AI use cases developed
internally and those acquired from third parties (e.g., other federal agencies,
contractors, partners, grantees, licensors, etc.). d. AI use case owners are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this section, to include necessary reporting to the Department
Responsible AI Official (RAIO) through the annual AI inventory. Accordingly,
Department personnel who wish to use AI as defined below should report the AI
Use Case to the RAIO via the annual inventory, indicating owner, purpose and
that the use will comply with the principles in
20 FAM 201.1-3(F)
. 20 fam 201.1-2
DEFINITIONS
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. Artificial Intelligence
:
This chapter defines Artificial Intelligence (AI) using NDAA Fiscal Year 2019
section 238(g), which includes any of the following:
(1)  Any artificial system that performs tasks under
varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or
that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data
sets. (2)  An artificial system developed in computer
software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring
human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or
physical action. (3)  An artificial system designed to think or act like
a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks.</div><div id="chunk-1" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (4)  A set of techniques, including machine learning,
that is designed to approximate a cognitive task. (5)  An artificial system designed to act rationally,
including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals
using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision
making, and acting. b.
Generative AI
:  Generative
AI refers to a sub-category of artificial intelligence techniques that generate
new data in the form of text, images, or video, using the data they were trained
on as a model, and an external input (like a question from a user) as a prompt. c.
AI Use Case:
An AI Use
Case is any Department application or use of AI described in either of the
following:
(1)  AI designed, developed, acquired, or used
specifically to advance the execution of the Department’s missions,
enhance decision making, or provide the public with a specified benefit. (2)  Both existing and new uses of AI; both standalone
AI and AI embedded within other systems or applications; AI developed both by
the Department or by third parties on behalf of the Department for the
fulfillment of specific Department missions, including relevant data inputs
used to train AI and outputs used in support of decision making; and the
Department’s procurement of AI applications. d.
AI service
:  An AI
application that consists of an AI system/tool/app provided by a third party
(e.g., an outside service provider). e.
Terms of Service (TOS)
:  For
the purposes of this chapter, a binding agreement between the provider of an AI
service and the Department of State regarding Department use of that provider's
AI service. Note:  This chapter uses "Terms of Service" to refer to
such agreements, irrespective of whether an AI service provider refers to such
agreements as “Terms of Service” or “Terms of Use”. 20 FAM 201.1-3
POLICY AND
procedures for ai use cases other than those for national security or defense
20 FAM 201.1-3(A)
Scope
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. The policies in this section, and in particular the
governance and inventory requirements, apply to all Department of State AI use
cases other than those for purposes of national security and defense. The
policies in this section do not apply to AI used, in whole or in part, in
defense or national security systems, as defined in 44 U.S.C.</div><div id="chunk-2" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> 3552(b)(6) or as
otherwise determine by the Department. AI use cases for purposes of national
security or defense are subject to principles as described in
20 FAM 201.1-4
below. b. The policies in this section do not apply to AI
embedded within common commercial products, such as word processors or map
navigation systems, or AI research and development activities. The principles
in this section and OMB implementation guidance should inform any R&D
directed at potential future applications of AI in the Federal Government. 20 FAM 201.1-3(B)

Department AI
Governance and Oversight Approach
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. Policy and procedures outlined in this chapter
should be implemented and overseen by individual bureaus and offices. This
requires each bureau and office, prior to instituting an AI use case, to
implement and document its oversight and governance processes for its AI use
cases, including by identifying individuals and positions that will perform
these functions. b. M/SS/CfA and the designated Responsible AI Official
(RAIO) work through the Enterprise Data Council (EDC), which reports to the
Enterprise Governance Board, to centrally promulgate and coordinate policy and
standards for AI governance in the Department. c.  Bureaus and offices that do not have positions and
individuals with the requisite skills and experience can request assistance
from other bureaus, such as M/SS/CfA, to institute and perform these oversight
and governance functions. d. Bureaus should contact M/SS/CfA with any questions
about the development and/or implementation of policies and procedures
involving AI. 20 FAM 201.1-3(D)
Roles and
Responsibilities
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. Responsible AI Official
(RAIO) - The RAIO is responsible for coordinating implementation of the
Principles of Trustworthy AI (Principles) within the Department. Trustworthy AI
must be designed and trained to follow fair, consistent, transparent,
impartial, reliable, and safe/secure decisions.</div><div id="chunk-4" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The RAIO coordinates Department
responses to, and compliance with, AI-related federal mandates, fosters
collaboration across AI-interested offices within the Department, and develops
and implements the Department’s responsible AI framework. Per E.O. 13960,
the RAIO also coordinates with the EDC and other relevant officials and
collaborates with interagency coordination bodies. When considering the
design, development, acquisition, and use of AI, the RAIO will be guided by the
Principles of Trustworthy AI set forth in
20 FAM 201.1-3(F)
. b.
AI Use Case Owners
- An AI
Use Case Owner is the bureau-level or office-level authority (as designated by
each bureau or office) over an AI Use Case. Each AI Use Case Owner is
responsible for ensuring their AI Use Cases comply with the applicable policy
and serves as the primary point of contact for their AI Use Cases during
reporting periods, including the preparation of an AI Inventory update and
certification described in
20
FAM 201.1-3(E)
. Each AI Use Case must have an associated owner, but owners
can be associated with multiple AI Use Cases. This role can be associated with
an individual or position. Bureaus and offices should ensure accounting for AI
Use Case Owners remains current. c.
Enterprise Data Council
(EDC) – The EDC works in concert with the RAIO and remains informed of
policy governing AI use cases within the Department. The EDC will serve as the
governing authority for dispute resolution on AI within the Department.</div><div id="chunk-5" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The
EDC is further defined in
20 FAM
102.1-1(B)
. d.
M/SS/CfA
– The
Department’s Chief Data Scientist in M/SS/CfA is responsible for holding
the RAIO role. e.
Principles of Trustworthy AI
- the principles set forth in
20
FAM 201.1-3(F)
paragraph (d), based on the Principles for Use of AI in
Government set forth in section 3 of E.O. 13960.
f.
Senior Agency Official for Privacy
(SAOP)
– The SAOP is responsible for managing privacy risk across
the Department and ensuring that privacy risk is mitigated in AI use cases that
use personally identifiable information. 20 FAM 201.1-3(E)
Department AI
Inventory
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. The Department must collect and maintain an
inventory of AI Use Cases, in part, to ensure that such work is consistent with
applicable law and policy. b. Each year, the RAIO in M/SS/CfA will initiate an
update to the Department’s AI Inventory. The RAIO will collect AI Use
Cases from domestic bureaus and offices and overseas posts, provide a version
to OMB according to their requirements, and post a public version of the AI
Inventory in accordance with criteria detailed below. The public version of AI
inventories from previous years may be helpful in illustrating the nature and
scope of AI Use Cases the inventory is intended to capture.</div><div id="chunk-6" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> c.
E.O. 13960
AI Inventory Exemptions
:  All Department AI Use
Cases will be collected in the annual AI Inventory. The following AI uses 
will not be included in the inventory:
(1)  AI used in defense or national security systems
(as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6) or as determined by the Department), in
whole or in part, although the Department shall adhere to other applicable
guidelines and principles for defense and national security purposes, such as
those adopted by the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence;
(2)  AI embedded within common commercial products,
such as word processors or map navigation systems, while noting that Government
use of such products must nevertheless comply with applicable laws and policies
to ensure the protection of safety, security, privacy, civil rights, and civil
liberties;
NOTE:  This exemption extends to uses of common
commercial generative AI tools on the internet, such as chatbots that return
text when prompted with a question, image generators that create pictures using
a descriptive prompt, and the like. (3)  AI research and development (R&D) activities,
although the principles and OMB implementation guidance should inform any
R&D directed at potential future applications of AI in the federal
government. d.
Public AI Inventory
: The
RAIO will publish a version of the AI Inventory for public consumption to the
extent practicable and in accordance with applicable laws and policies,
including those concerning the protection of privacy and of sensitive law
enforcement, national security, and other protected information. AI Use Case
Owners are responsible for identifying AI Use Cases that are exempt from the E.O. 13960 inventory and AI Use Cases that are SBU, in coordination with the RAIO. If
there are AI Use Cases that are not exempt from the E.O. 13960 inventory but
they meet SBU criteria as defined in
12
FAM 541
, they should presumptively not be included in the public AI
inventory.</div><div id="chunk-7" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> In cases where the AI Use Case Owners have requested that an AI Use
Case be withheld from the public AI Inventory because it is SBU, the RAIO will
not publish the AI Use Case unless the AI Use Case Owner has cleared on release
of the information and has obtained approval from someone at the DAS-level or
above or a subject matter expert at the bureau(s)/office(s) with equities in
the AI Use Case. The same procedure will be followed in situations where the
AI Use Case Owners have identified that an AI Use Case is SBU and would like to
include it in the public AI Inventory. (1)  Information included in the public AI inventory
will include the bureau/office that owns the use case, the name of the use
case, and a description. The public AI inventory will not include any
underlying data or findings. (2)  AI Use Cases are considered SBU, and therefore can
be withheld from the public AI inventory, if the existence of an application or
use of AI is SBU. For example, an AI Use Case might be considered SBU where
the existence of an application or use of AI reveals law enforcement techniques
used in ongoing investigations. The definition of SBU information can be found
at
12 FAM 541
(a). (3)  Types of unclassified information to which SBU is
typically applied can be found at
12
FAM 541
(b). e.
Annual Compliance Certification
: 
In producing the annual AI Inventory, AI Use Cases must also be certified as
compliant with the principles in this section. (1)  For any AI Use Cases that are not compliant, AI
Use Case Owners must develop a plan to ensure compliance within six months, or
they must retire the application.</div><div id="chunk-8" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> M/SS/CfA will work with all AI Use Case
Owners to facilitate compliance within this timeframe. (2)  The Department RAIO will share the inventories
with other agencies, to the extent practicable and consistent with applicable
laws and policies, including those concerning protection of privacy and of
sensitive law enforcement, national security, and other protected information. 20 FAM 201.1-3(F)
Governance
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. Each bureau or office that owns an AI use case must
have a documented AI governance structure. Governance documentation must
specify the bureau's roles and responsibilities, procedures for review and
certification of compliance, and an inventory of all AI use cases (that will be
collected by the RAIO once yearly). While specific AI oversight and governance
procedures may vary, each bureau or office is required to certify and retain
evidence that each AI use case in development, or currently in use, complies
with the Principles of Trustworthy AI set forth in this section. b. AI use case owners are encouraged to use the
Department of State Responsible AI System Card as a guide. c.  M/SS/CfA is responsible for ensuring the
availability of appropriate training to all State Department personnel
responsible for the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI. M/SS/CfA
has additional guidance, assessment, and “best practices” documents
available for further clarification. d. The principles below, as they apply to the
Department of State, are intended to ensure the Department's AI use cases
comply with E.O.</div><div id="chunk-9" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> 13960:
(1)
Lawful. AI use case owners
must design, develop, acquire, and use AI in a manner that is consistent with
the Constitution and all other applicable laws and policies, including those
addressing privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and intellectual property. (a)  This means understanding and abiding by any specific
legal or regulatory requirements concerning the data being used as well as any
such requirements that pertain to the processes and systems the AI use case
affects. (b)  AI applications should include internal and external
checks to help ensure equitable application across all participants. (c)  Individual privacy must be respected and data must
not be used in a manner inconsistent with privacy laws and policies applicable
to such data; use of data should be approved by the data steward (defined in
20 FAM 101.1-3
). AI systems must
be protected from risks (including threats to privacy and cybersecurity) that
may directly or indirectly cause physical and/or digital harm to any
individual. (d)  AI use cases utilizing PII must abide by existing
privacy laws and policies, including
5
FAM 460
. Use case owners must consult with the Privacy Office in design of
their use case governance plan when data elements include PII. (e)  As AI is a new yet fast-emerging field of
technology, the legal landscape relating to AI applications is unsettled and
evolving. Department components should consult with L/M when initiating
development of AI Use Cases.</div><div id="chunk-10" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> L/M might consult other L offices depending on
the type of AI. (2)
Purposeful, performance-driven,
accurate, reliable, and effective
. AI use case owners must seek
opportunities for designing, developing, acquiring, and using AI only where the
benefits of doing so significantly outweigh the risks, and the risks can be
assessed, managed, and documented. They must also ensure that their
application of AI is consistent with the use cases for which that AI was
trained, and such use is accurate, reliable, and effective. (a)  AI use cases should have the ability to learn from
humans and other systems and produce consistent, accurate, and reliable outputs
consistent with the original design. (3)
Safe, secure, and resilient. AI use case owners must ensure the safety, security, and resiliency of their AI
use cases, including resilience when confronted with systematic vulnerabilities,
adversarial manipulation, and other malicious exploitation. (4)
Understandable and transparent
. AI use case owners must ensure that the operations and outcomes of their AI use
cases are sufficiently understandable by subject matter experts, users, and
others as appropriate. AI use case owners should also be transparent when
providing relevant information regarding their use of AI to appropriate
stakeholders, such as Congress and the public, to the extent such disclosure is
in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy and is practicable
balancing transparency with sensitivity of data and methods.</div><div id="chunk-11" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> (a)  All relevant individuals should be able to
understand how data is being used as an input to the AI use case, the model(s)
used in the AI use case, and how the outputs of the AI use case are used to
make decisions. Attributes, correlations, and other relevant measures for
population baselining, where appropriate, should be open to inspection. (b)  Outcomes of AI use cases that impact policy or other
decision-making processes should uphold scientific integrity as described in
11 FAM 820
. (5)
Responsible, traceable, accountable,
and regularly monitored
. AI use case owners must ensure that human
roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, understood, and appropriately
assigned for the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI. AI use case
owners are accountable for implementing and enforcing appropriate safeguards
for the proper use and functioning of their application of AI and shall
monitor, audit, and document compliance with those safeguards. Additionally,
AI use case owners must ensure that AI use cases are regularly tested against
the principles in this paragraph. (a)  Policies should outline governance and who is held
responsible for all aspects of the AI solution (e.g., initiation, development,
outputs, decommissioning). (6)  Bureaus should contact M/SS/CfA with any questions
about the development and/or implementation of policies and procedures
involving AI. 20 FAM 201.1-3(G)
Terms of
Service
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. The provider of an AI service will generally have in
place standard Terms of Service (TOS) that apply to use of that AI service.</div><div id="chunk-12" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> As
with TOS in other contexts (e.g., the TOS of social media platforms; see
10 FAM 185
), the TOS of AI service
providers, being commercially oriented, often contain various terms not legally
compatible with or advisable for U.S. Government agencies under Federal law. b. As such, acceptance of an AI service
provider’s TOS on behalf of the Department may only occur after review
and approval of the TOS by the Office of the Legal Adviser (L). L may find it
necessary for the TOS to be amended or otherwise modified. Additionally, only
direct-hire Department employees may accept/agree to such TOS on behalf of the
Department. c.  Creation of a user account with an AI service
typically involves acceptance of the TOS applicable to that AI service. Department personnel may not create user accounts in their official capacity
with an AI service unless the TOS associated with that AI service has been
approved by L and the AI service is authorized for official use by appropriate
Department policy components. 20 FAM 201.1-3(H)
Intellectual
Property
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. AI services--especially those based upon generative
AI technology--are typically "trained" by their providers on
voluminous datasets, and often also allow end users to themselves input
datasets when entering prompts. Upon entering a textual or other prompt in an
AI service, a user prompts the AI service to generate a work or works based
upon the dataset training the service has received. b.</div><div id="chunk-13" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Because such datasets may contain/utilize publicly
available data/works subject to or protected by copyright and other
intellectual property (IP) rights, both the input into and generation of works
via AI services can raise IP infringement considerations depending upon the
circumstances. Further, the use (e.g., copying, distribution, display,
creation of derivatives) of works generated via AI services can likewise raise
IP infringement considerations depending upon the circumstances. c.  When utilizing AI services in an official capacity,
Department personnel are not to input into AI services (whether through user
prompts or datasets) any content protected by copyright or other IP rights
absent appropriate permission from the relevant rightsholders. d. Because an AI-generated work is not typically
accompanied by any attribution to the party that produced it or any information
as to the inputs entered into the AI service by the producing party, Department
personnel are not to use AI service-generated works produced by third parties
(e.g., AI service-generated works appearing on third-party websites). e. Department personnel are advised to consult with L
when initiating development of AI Use Cases, in particular those expected to
involve public-facing use of works generated via AI services. 20 FAM 201.1-4
Department Use of artificial
intelligence for defense and national security purposes
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
a. Consistent with Sections 1 and 9 of E.O. 13960,
Department use of AI for the purposes of national security or defense
(including all AI used, in whole or in part, in defense or national security
systems, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6) or as otherwise determined by the
Department) are subject to the principles described in this section. As such,
please consult 44 U.S.C.</div><div id="chunk-14" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> 3552(b)(6) (national security) and M/SS/CfA (defense)
to determine whether an AI Use Case is outside of the scope of the
Department’s AI inventory and is subject to the principles detailed
below. b. Questions about how to categorize AI Use Cases
should be directed to the Department’s Chief Data Officer and Chief Data
Scientist in M/SS/CfA for assistance. 20 FAM 201.1-4(A)
Use for Purposes
of Defense
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
Questions about whether AI is being used for the
purposes of defense should be directed to the Department’s Chief Data
Officer and Chief Data Scientist in M/SS/CfA for assistance in coordination
with any other appropriate Department defense program office. Any Department
use of artificial intelligence for the purposes of defense shall be subject to
the principles below (as derived from “The Department of Defense (DoD) Artificial
Intelligence Principles and Framework”):
(1)
Responsible. Department
personnel will exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care, while
remaining responsible for the development, deployment, and use of AI
capabilities. (2)
Equitable. The Department
will take deliberate steps to minimize unintended bias in AI capabilities. (3)
Traceable. The
Department’s AI capabilities will be developed and deployed such that
relevant personnel possess an appropriate understanding of the technology,
development processes, and operational methods applicable to AI capabilities,
including with transparent and auditable methodologies, data sources, and
design procedure and documentation.</div><div id="chunk-15" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> (4)
Reliable. The
Department’s AI capabilities will have explicit, well
‐
defined uses, and the
safety, security, and effectiveness of such capabilities will be subject to
testing and assurance within those defined uses across their entire life
‐
cycles. (5)
Governable. The Department
will design and engineer AI capabilities to fulfill their intended functions
while possessing the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences, and
the ability to disengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate
unintended behavior. 20 FAM 201.1-4(B)
Use For Purposes
of National Security
(CT:DATA-2;   04-24-2023)
Questions about whether AI is being used for the purposes
of national security should be directed to the Department’s Chief Data
Officer and Chief Data Scientist in M/SS/CfA for assistance in coordination
with any other appropriate Department program office (also see 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6)). Any Department use of artificial intelligence for the purposes of
national security (see definitions in
12
FAM 013
and
12 FAM 271.2
)
shall be subject to the principles below (as derived from “The Principles
of Artificial Intelligence Ethics for the Intelligence Community”):
·
Respect the Law and Act with Integrity. The Department will employ AI in a manner that respects human dignity, rights,
and freedoms. The Department’s use of AI will fully comply with
applicable legal authorities and with policies and procedures that protect
privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. ·
Transparent and Accountable.</div><div id="chunk-16" class="text-chunk" /><a name="chunk-16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> The
Department will provide appropriate transparency regarding its AI methods,
applications, and uses within the bounds of security, technology, and
releasability by law and policy, and will develop and employ mechanisms to
identify responsibilities and provide accountability for the use of AI and its
outcomes. ·
Objective and Equitable. Consistent with
its mission the Department will take affirmative steps to identify and mitigate
bias. ·
Human-Centered Development and Use. The
Department will develop and use AI to augment our national security and enhance
