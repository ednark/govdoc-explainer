Certainly! Below is a minimal list of actions that a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design (HCD), responsible for User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI), must take to show compliance with relevant standards from the Government Standards Document:

1. **Lawful Design**:
   - Ensure all UX/UI designs comply with applicable laws and policies, including privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.
   
2. **Bias Minimization**:
   - Implement design choices that minimize unintended bias in AI-generated content and user interactions.

3. **Transparency**:
   - Design interfaces that clearly communicate how AI decisions are made, ensuring users have a basic understanding of the AIâ€™s functioning.
   
4. **User Consent**:
   - Include clear and accessible consent forms for any personal data collection, ensuring transparency about data use.

5. **Accessibility**:
   - Design UX/UI to be accessible to all users, following standard accessibility guidelines to ensure equitable user experience.

6. **Accountability Indicators**:
   - Include features that allow users to report issues and give feedback on AI interactions, supporting ongoing monitoring and improvement.

7. **Data Privacy**:
   - Ensure user interfaces allow users to manage their own data (e.g., view, edit, delete personal data).

8. **Safety Warnings**:
   - Implement notifications for any potential risks associated with AI features, ensuring user awareness and consent.

9. **Error Mitigation**:
   - Design the UI to handle AI errors gracefully with clear messages and alternative user pathways.

10. **Testing Protocols**:
    - Conduct regular usability and resilience testing to ensure the design remains secure and effective against vulnerabilities and adversarial manipulations.

By focusing on these actions, the Designer can help ensure the web application complies with the necessary government AI standards while maintaining a user-centered approach.
