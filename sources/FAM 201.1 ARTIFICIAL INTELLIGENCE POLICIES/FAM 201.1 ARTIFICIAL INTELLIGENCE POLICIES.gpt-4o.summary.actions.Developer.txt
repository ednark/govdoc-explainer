For a Developer implementing a web application with Drupal, here is a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with the Government Standards Document related to AI:

1. **Understand AI Requirements:**
   - Read and understand the specific AI-related policies, especially the definitions and principles (20 FAM 201.1-1, 20 FAM 201.1-3(F)).

2. **Identify AI Use Cases:**
   - Determine if the project includes any AI components (refer to 20 FAM 201.1-2(c)).

3. **Document AI Use Cases:**
   - Document AI Use Cases, including purpose, data sources, and the AI model used (20 FAM 201.1-3(E)).

4. **Ensure Legal Compliance:**
   - Ensure the AI application adheres to applicable laws, including privacy and security regulations (20 FAM 201.1-3(F)(1)).

5. **Check Data Usage:**
   - Verify data used complies with privacy and integrity standards (20 FAM 201.1-3(F)(1)(c)).

6. **Implement Trustworthy AI Principles:**
