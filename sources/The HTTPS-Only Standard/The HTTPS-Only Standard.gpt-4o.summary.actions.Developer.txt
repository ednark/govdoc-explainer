### Minimal List of Actions for Compliance (Developer Perspective)

1. **Enable HTTPS:**
   - Ensure the website is served over HTTPS by configuring the server.

2. **Acquire and Install Certificate:**
   - Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   - Install the certificate on the web server.

3. **Force HTTPS Redirect:**
   - Configure the server to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
   - Ensure HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers specify a max-age of at least 1 year.

4. **Update External Resources:**
   - Ensure all external resources (images, scripts, etc.) are loaded over HTTPS. Update references in code as needed.

5. **Configure Drupal for HTTPS:**
   - Update Drupal settings to ensure all site URLs use HTTPS.
   - Enable HTTPS enforcement modules if available.

6. **Update API Endpoints:**
   - Ensure all API endpoints are accessible over HTTPS.
   - Change hardcoded URLs within the application to HTTPS.

7. **Implement HSTS:**
   - Configure the web server to include HSTS headers with a max-age of at least 1 year.

8. **Monitor and Maintain Certificates:**
   - Set up monitoring for certificate expiration and automate renewal if possible.

9. **Test HTTPS Implementation:**
   - Verify that all website interactions are securely conducted over HTTPS.
   - Check for mixed content issues and resolve them.

10. **Update Configuration for Performance:**
    - Ensure the server is configured to use HTTP/2 or SPDY protocols.
    - Evaluate and implement Server Name Indication (SNI) if serving multiple domains.

11. **Plan for Future Updates:**
    - Stay informed about updates to HTTPS standards and best practices through resources like https.cio.gov.
