To ensure compliance with the HTTPS-All Standard from the perspective of a Designer focusing on User Experience and User Interface, here are the key actions you must take:

1. **Secure All Connections**: Implement HTTPS to secure all data transmissions between the user’s browser and the server. This includes encrypting cookies, user agent details, URL paths, form submissions, and query parameters.

2. **Avoid Mixed Content**: Ensure that all externally referenced resources such as images, scripts, fonts, and iframes are loaded over HTTPS to prevent security warnings and blockages by modern browsers.

3. **Implement HSTS**: Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) on your domain to force browsers to only use secure connections, reducing the risk of downgrade attacks and secure cookies theft.

4. **Design for Redirects**: Ensure that any HTTP connections are redirected to HTTPS to maintain security throughout the user experience and prevent user access through unsecured channels.

5. **Maintain User Trust with UI Indicators**: Design user interfaces that clearly indicate a secure connection, such as showing lock icons or using system notifications when a page is loaded over HTTPS, to reinforce trust and security awareness.

6. **Plan for Performance Impact**: Address any user experience issues that may arise due to the additional latency introduced by HTTPS encryption, particularly on resource-heavy websites, and optimize accordingly.

7. **Check for Browser Compatibility**: Ensure that the website’s features and security implementations are compatible across all major browsers, particularly with functionalities like Server Name Indication (SNI) and HSTS.

8. **Monitor and Update**: Regularly check for updates on security practices and protocols related to HTTPS to keep the website compliant with the latest standards and secure against vulnerabilities.

9. **Educate and Inform**: Include clear information on the site about the security measures in place, such as HTTPS and HSTS, to educate users on how their data is protected.

By focusing on these actions, you will ensure that the web application not only complies with government standards for privacy and security but also delivers a safe and positive user experience.
