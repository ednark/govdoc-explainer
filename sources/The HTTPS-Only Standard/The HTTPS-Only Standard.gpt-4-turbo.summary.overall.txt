### Summary of Government Standards Document: HTTPS-Only Standard

#### Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements:
1. **Secure Connection Requirement**: All publicly accessible Federal websites and web services must only provide service through HTTPS to ensure data privacy and integrity.
   
2. **Compliance Deadline**:
   - Existing websites and services must transition to HTTPS-only by December 31, 2016.
   - Newly developed Federal websites and services must implement HTTPS upon launch.

3. **HTTPS Implementation**:
   - HTTPS encrypts almost all data exchanged, like URL paths and cookies, ensuring protection against interception and alteration.
   - Agencies must use certificates from trusted authorities to verify website authenticity.

4. **Planning and Adaptation**:
   - Agencies should be prepared to update security measures regularly to address emerging vulnerabilities and maintain compliance with evolving web standards.

5. **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**:
   - Websites must implement HSTS to force browsers to use HTTPS, minimizing risks from insecure redirects.

6. **Mixed Content Management**:
   - All external resources on Federal websites must be loaded over HTTPS to prevent security vulnerabilities.

7. **Efficiency and Performance**:
   - Use of modern technologies like SPDY or HTTP/2 is recommended to improve site performance without compromising security.

#### Sections Focused On:
- **Security**: Enforcing HTTPS, use of HSTS, certificate validation to prevent impersonation, and handling mixed content.
- **Accessibility**: Making all existing and new Federal websites accessible via secure HTTPS connections.
- **User Experience**: Ensuring private and consistent browsing experience across Federal websites by universally applying HTTPS.
- **Compliance**:
   - Immediate implementation of HTTPS for newly launched sites.
   - Complete transition for existing sites by a set deadline.
   - Continuous monitoring and updates necessitated by evolving standards.

These summarized points reflect the essence of the HTTPS-Only Standard as directed in the government standards document and highlight the document's emphasis on maintaining a secure, accessible, and compliant digital presence for Federal entities.
