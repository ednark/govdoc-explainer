## Summary of the HTTPS-Only Standard Document

### Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

1. **HTTPS Mandate**: All publicly accessible Federal websites and web services must serve their content over HTTPS to ensure secure connections. 
   
2. **Compliance Deadline**: Federal agencies must transition all existing public websites and services to HTTPS-only by December 31, 2016.

3. **Security**: Websites must use HTTPS, which encrypts data transferred between the user and the website, ensuring privacy and protecting against data interception and alteration. Implementation of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is required to enforce HTTPS connections without allowing HTTP.

4. **Certificate Authorities**: Use certified authorities to issue HTTPS certificates, ensuring the websiteâ€™s authenticity to users.

5. **Mixed Content**: All external resources on these websites (like images and scripts) must be loaded over HTTPS to avoid security risks.

6. **Server Performance**: Adoption of HTTP/2 or SPDY protocols which require HTTPS is encouraged to improve server performance and latency.

7. **Monitoring and Updates**: Regular updates to protocols, certificates, and configurations are needed to address emerging security vulnerabilities.

8. **Public Dashboard**: Compliance monitoring through a public dashboard at pulse.cio.gov.

### Focus Areas

- **Security**: Encryption of data, use of certificate authorities, and mandatory HTTPS deployment ensure robust security standards.
- **Accessibility**: Transition to HTTPS-only for all public-facing services by the set deadline ensures uniform access under secure conditions.
- **User Experience**: Consistent application of HTTPS enhances trust and security perception among users.
- **Compliance**: Strict compliance deadlines and public monitoring via a central dashboard ensure that all agencies adhere to these standards.

### Concise Summary

All federal publicly accessible websites must use HTTPS to secure user data by the end of 2016. This move guarantees the security and integrity of user interactions through encryption and authenticated connections. Agencies must monitor and update their security protocols regularly, ensuring compliance via a central dashboard. This standard raises both the user's trust and the overall security posture of federal online services.
