1. **Ensure Secure URLs**: Design the application so that all external and internal links, as well as form submissions, utilize HTTPS URLs.

2. **Validate Secure Resources**: Ensure that all embedded or linked resources such as images, scripts, fonts, and iframes are loaded over HTTPS to prevent mixed content issues.

3. **Encourage HTTPS Redirections**: Design workflows and navigation structures that assume HTTPS as the default protocol, even guiding users subtly to secure versions of the site if accessed via HTTP.

4. **Inform Users About Security**: Incorporate messaging or indications within the User Interface that inform users about the security measures in place, such as encrypted connections.

5. **Visual Cues for Secure Interaction**: Implement design elements that visually indicate when a user is entering, transmitting, or interacting with sensitive information, reinforcing the security of the HTTPS connection.

6. **Accessible Security Features**: Ensure that any security features or warnings are accessible, providing support for all users, including those with disabilities, to understand the security context.

7. **Adapt Designs for Stringent Security**: Prepare designs that are adaptable to enhancements in security standards, such as changes in HTTPS protocols or new browser security policies. 

8. **Privacy Design Standards**: Adopt design principles that inherently respect user privacy and emphasize data protection, aligning with the goals of HTTPS for secure and private user interactions. 

By focusing on these design-centric elements, you ensure that the user experience of the web application fully supports and enhances the HTTPS security guidelines required by the government standards.
