**Government Standards Document Summary: The HTTPS-Only Standard**

**Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements:**

1. **Primary Standard**:
   - All public-facing federal websites and web services must use HTTPS.
   
2. **Security**:
   - HTTPS encrypts data, ensuring privacy and integrity during transfers.
   - Website identity is verified through trusted certificate authorities.
   - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) must be enabled to enforce HTTPS.
   - Mixed content (non-HTTPS resources) must be avoided on HTTPS websites.
   
3. **Accessibility**:
   - New sites must comply with HTTPS standards at launch.
   - Existing sites must transition to HTTPS based on a prioritized risk assessment.
   
4. **User Experience**:
   - HTTPS protects user data, improving trust and privacy.
   - Browser compatibility must be considered, especially for mixed content.
   - Site performance may improve with HTTPS and HTTP/2 protocols.
   
5. **Compliance**:
   - All domains and subdomains must use HTTPS by December 31, 2016.
   - A public dashboard at pulse.cio.gov monitors compliance.
   - HTTPS guidelines apply to internet-facing sites, not necessarily intranets.
   - HTTP can be used only for redirecting to HTTPS.
