As a Human-Centered Design specialist, I've distilled the key actions to show compliance with HTTPS standards:

1. **Get an SSL certificate**: Obtain a digital certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
2. **Configure Server Name Indication (SNI)**: Enable SNI on your server to support multiple domains.
3. **Migrate all content to HTTPS**: Update all HTTP links to HTTPS and ensure secure connections for images, scripts, and other resources.
4. **Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Add HSTS headers to instruct browsers to use HTTPS for the domain.
5. **Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS**: Set up redirects from HTTP to HTTPS to maintain existing URLs.
6. **Monitor and update certificates regularly**: Ensure timely renewal and updating of SSL certificates.

These minimal actions will help demonstrate compliance with the HTTPS standards, allowing you to focus on creating a seamless user experience for your application's users.
