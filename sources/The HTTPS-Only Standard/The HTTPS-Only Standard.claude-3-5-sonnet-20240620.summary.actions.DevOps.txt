From the perspective of a DevOps technician designing and managing infrastructure to support the web application, here's a minimal list of actions to show compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard:

1. Implement HTTPS for all public-facing web services
2. Obtain and install valid SSL/TLS certificates from a trusted certificate authority
3. Configure web servers to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
4. Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers
5. Ensure all resources (images, scripts, etc.) are served over HTTPS
6. Set up automatic certificate renewal process
7. Configure servers to use modern TLS protocols and strong cipher suites
8. Implement Server Name Indication (SNI) for efficient IP address usage
9. Set up monitoring for HTTPS compliance and certificate expiration
10. Ensure infrastructure supports rapid updates to HTTPS configurations

These actions focus on the technical implementation and maintenance of HTTPS from an infrastructure perspective, which aligns with the DevOps technician's role.
