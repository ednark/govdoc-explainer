From the perspective of a Drupal developer implementing backend business logic, here's a minimal list of actions to show compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard:

1. Ensure the Drupal site is accessible only via HTTPS.

2. Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection.

3. Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for the domain.

4. Update internal links and resources to use HTTPS URLs.

5. Configure Drupal to use secure cookies.

6. Ensure all external API calls from Drupal use HTTPS.

7. Update any custom modules to support HTTPS-only connections.

8. Verify that Drupal's base URL setting uses HTTPS.

9. Check and update any hardcoded URLs in the codebase to use HTTPS.

10. Ensure Drupal's .htaccess file (or equivalent) enforces HTTPS.
