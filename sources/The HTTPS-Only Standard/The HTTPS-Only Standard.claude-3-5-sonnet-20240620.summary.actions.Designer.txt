From the perspective of a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design and responsible for UX/UI, here's a minimal list of actions to show compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard:

1. Ensure all UI elements (buttons, links, forms) use HTTPS URLs.

2. Update any hardcoded HTTP references in design assets to HTTPS.

3. Design a visual indicator for secure connections (e.g., padlock icon).

4. Create user-friendly error messages for potential HTTPS-related issues.

5. Adjust layouts to accommodate longer HTTPS URLs if necessary.

6. Design a seamless redirect experience from HTTP to HTTPS.

7. Ensure all external resources (images, fonts, etc.) are loaded via HTTPS.

8. Create a privacy-focused UX that aligns with HTTPS security principles.

9. Design clear user communications about the switch to HTTPS if applicable.

10. Ensure responsive designs work correctly with HTTPS on all devices.
