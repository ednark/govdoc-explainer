As a developer specializing in Drupal, here's a minimal list of actions to show compliance with standards:

1. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate:
	* Purchase or obtain a trusted SSL/TLS certificate from a reputable Certificate Authority (CA).
2. Configure SSL/TLS on the server:
	* Enable SSL/TLS on your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to serve HTTPS requests.
3. Update Drupal configuration:
	* In your Drupal site's settings.php file, update the $base_url variable to include the "https" protocol.
4. Update links and references:
	* Replace all hardcoded HTTP URLs with HTTPS equivalents in your theme templates, module code, and JavaScript files.
5. Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):
	* In your Drupal site's .htaccess file or web server configuration, add a header to enable HSTS: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`.
6. Test and verify:
	* Test your site thoroughly to ensure all internal and external resources are loading correctly over HTTPS.
	* Verify that HTTP requests are being redirected to HTTPS using tools like curl or browser developer tools.

By following these steps, you'll demonstrate compliance with the standards for a Drupal-based web application.
