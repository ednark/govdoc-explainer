To ensure compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard for a web application project from the project management perspective, the following actions should be taken:

1. **Inventory Check**: List all existing web applications and determine their current status regarding HTTPS implementation.

2. **Requirement Specification**: Clearly specify the requirement for HTTPS in the projectâ€™s technical requirements document.

3. **Implementation Plan Development**: Develop a detailed plan for deploying HTTPS on new web applications straight away and for transitioning existing applications to HTTPS.

4. **Procurement of Certificates**: Arrange for the purchase and management of SSL/TLS certificates from a trusted certificate authority.

5. **Configuration of HTTPS**: Ensure that the web applications are configured to use HTTPS, including setting up the server and installing certificates.

6. **Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: Configure web applications to include HSTS to enforce secure connections.

7. **Mixed Content Audit**: Audit applications for mixed content to ensure that all resources (images, scripts, etc.) are served over HTTPS.

8. **Performance Optimization**: Consider performance impacts of HTTPS and implement HTTP/2 and Server Name Indication (SNI) where applicable.

9. **Compliance Verification**: Verify that all applications meet HTTPS requirements by conducting security audits and penetration testing.

10. **Continual Monitoring and Updating**: Establish procedures for ongoing monitoring and timely updates of security certificates and compliance with new HTTPS guidelines.

11. **Training and Documentation**: Provide training sessions for development and IT teams on HTTPS implementation and maintain thorough documentation of the security configurations and protocols implemented.

12. **Client Engagement and Reporting**: Regularly update the client on progress and compliance status and involve them in key decisions, ensuring they understand the importance of HTTPS.

By following these steps, a project manager will be able to effectively coordinate the tasks necessary to meet the Government's HTTPS-Only Standard, ensuring privacy and security for users accessing federal websites and services.
