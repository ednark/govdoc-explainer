## Minimal actions to show compliance from a Drupal developer's perspective:

1. **Review project dependencies:** Identify and update all external libraries and modules to HTTPS-only versions.
2. **Review codebase:** Identify and update any hardcoded HTTP connections to HTTPS.
3. **Install HSTS:** Configure and enable HTTP Strict Transport Security on the server.
4. **Test HTTPS:** Perform comprehensive testing to ensure the application functions seamlessly over HTTPS.
