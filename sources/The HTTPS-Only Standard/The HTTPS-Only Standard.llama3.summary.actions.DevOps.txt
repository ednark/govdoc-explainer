To demonstrate compliance with the standards, as a DevOps technician, you can take the following minimal list of actions on your project:

1. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain.
2. Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to serve only HTTPS requests.
3. Update any external resource URLs (e.g., images, scripts) to use HTTPS.
4. Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) by adding the necessary headers to your website's configuration file (e.g., Apache's `.htaccess` or Nginx's `nginx.conf`).
5. Ensure that all internal and external redirects are served over HTTPS.

By taking these actions, you can demonstrate compliance with the standards and ensure that your web application is serving its contents securely over HTTPS.
