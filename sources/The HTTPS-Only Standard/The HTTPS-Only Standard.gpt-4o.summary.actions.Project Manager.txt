Certainly! Here is a streamlined list of actions a project manager should track to ensure compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard for a web application project:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Perform a risk-based analysis to prioritize existing web services and sites.

2. **Procurement of Certificates:**
   - Obtain digital certificates from a trusted certificate authority.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Ensure all new websites and services launch with HTTPS.
   - Migrate existing websites and services to HTTPS.

4. **HSTS Implementation:**
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

5. **Content Review:**
   - Update all external resources (images, scripts, fonts, etc.) to load over HTTPS.

6. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Perform functional testing to ensure all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
   - Validate the correctness and performance of the SSL/TLS configurations.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Establish monitoring to check HTTPS connections and HSTS status.
   - Plan for regular updates and renewals of SSL/TLS certificates.

8. **Client Coordination:**
   - Communicate the timelines and roles involved for the clientâ€™s internal resources.
   - Guide client to review security practices and adherence to government standards periodically.

9. **Compliance Deadline:**
   - Ensure all actions are completed within internal deadlines to meet the December 31, 2016 compliance date.

By keeping track of these actions, the project manager can ensure the web application meets the HTTPS-Only Standard requirements efficiently.
