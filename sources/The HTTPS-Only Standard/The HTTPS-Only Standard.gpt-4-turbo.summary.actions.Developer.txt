1. **Implement HTTPS**: Ensure that all publicly accessible webpages and services are served over HTTPS.

2. **Configure TLS**: Set up Transport Layer Security (TLS) on the web server to ensure secure communication.

3. **Obtain and Install SSL Certificate**: Acquire and configure a valid SSL certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

4. **Enable HSTS**: Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) on your server to enforce secure (HTTPS) connections.

5. **Set Up Redirects**: Configure server settings to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS to ensure that connections are always secure.

6. **Secure Cookies**: Set cookies with the "secure" attribute to ensure they are sent over HTTPS connections only.

7. **Update Links and Resources**: Check and update all internal and external links and resources to use HTTPS to prevent mixed content issues.

8. **Verify Mixed Content**: Audit the application to ensure no active mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages) exists, replacing or removing insecure elements.

9. **Monitor and Update TLS Configurations**: Regularly review and optimize your TLS settings to maintain security standards and comply with new guidelines.

10. **Test Compliance**: Use tools to test HTTPS implementation, HSTS headers, and overall SSL/TLS configuration to ensure compliance with the government standards.
