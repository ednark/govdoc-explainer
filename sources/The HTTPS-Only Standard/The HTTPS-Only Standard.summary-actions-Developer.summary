To ensure compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard as a Drupal developer, here is a concise list of actions that must be taken:

1. **Enable HTTPS on New and Existing Websites:** Make certain that all new websites you develop, as well as existing ones, use HTTPS (not HTTP) to secure all communications between the user's browser and the website. This includes ensuring all test and staging environments are also under HTTPS.

2. **Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Configure HSTS on your Drupal sites to force browsers to only use secure connections. This can usually be accomplished via web server configurations or Drupal security modules that manage HTTP headers.

3. **Purchase and Install SSL/TLS Certificates:** Acquire SSL/TLS certificates from a recognized Certificate Authority (CA) to authenticate your website’s identity. Install these certificates on your server according to the server's documentation.

4. **Configure TLS for Optimal Security:** Set up Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to ensure that data in transit is encrypted and secure. Keep the SSL/TLS protocols up to date and disable outdated protocols like SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 in favor of TLS 1.2 and above.

5. **Manage Mixed Content:** Ensure that all external resources such as images, scripts, CSS, and third-party plugins loaded by your Drupal sites are served over HTTPS to avoid mixed content issues that can undermine the security of your HTTPS deployment.

6. **Update and Secure Infrastructure:** Regularly update your Drupal installation and its modules to keep security measures up-to-date. Apply security patches promptly to protect against vulnerabilities.

7. **Monitor and Optimize Performance:** Given the overhead that HTTPS can add, optimize website performance through caching, using Content Delivery Networks (CDN), and ensuring efficient server configurations. Monitor the impact on performance from SSL/TLS and adjust configurations as necessary.

8. **Utilize Server Name Indication (SNI):** If your web server hosts multiple domains, configure Server Name Indication to efficiently manage multiple SSL certificates on a single IP address.

9. **Implement DNSSEC (Optional but Recommended):** Though not mandatory for HTTPS, consider implementing Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to protect against DNS spoofing and to ensure the integrity of DNS queries.

10. **Continual Monitoring for Compliance:** Regularly check the configuration of your Drupal sites against best practices and compliance requirements. Utilize tools like the SSL Labs' SSL Test to evaluate your site’s SSL/TLS security and compliance with current standards.

By systematically implementing these steps, you'll align your Drupal development work with the requirements of the HTTPS-Only Standard, enhancing the security and integrity of the web applications you develop for the Federal Government.
