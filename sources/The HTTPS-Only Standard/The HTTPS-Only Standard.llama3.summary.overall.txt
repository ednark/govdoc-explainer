1. HTTPS (Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
2. TLS (Transport Layer Security) with Server Name Indication
3. DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security)
4. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

**Guidelines:**

1. Enable HSTS to instruct compliant browsers to use HTTPS
2. Prioritize deployment using a risk-based analysis
3. Make existing websites and services accessible through a secure connection (HTTPS-only) by December 31, 2016

**Requirements:**

1. Newly developed websites and services must use HTTPS upon launch
2. Existing websites and services with sensitive content or high traffic must prioritize migration to HTTPS
3. All Federal agencies must deploy HTTPS on their domains using the guidelines above

**Security:**

* Use HTTPS (TLS) for secure connections
* Enable HSTS to prevent insecure redirects
* Prioritize deployment of DNSSEC for domain name system security

**Accessibility:**

* Make existing websites and services accessible through a secure connection (HTTPS-only)
* Allow HTTP connections for redirecting clients to HTTPS connections

**Compliance:**

* Agencies must comply with the guidelines by December 31, 2016
* A public dashboard will monitor agency compliance at pulse.cio.gov
