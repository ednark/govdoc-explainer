From a project manager's perspective, here's a minimal list of actions to show compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard for a web application:

1. Acquire SSL/TLS certificate for the domain
2. Install and configure SSL/TLS certificate on web server
3. Update all internal links to use HTTPS
4. Ensure all external resources (images, scripts, etc.) use HTTPS
5. Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirects
6. Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
7. Update any hard-coded URLs in the application to use HTTPS
8. Test the website thoroughly using HTTPS
9. Monitor and plan for regular certificate renewals
10. Document compliance for stakeholders

These actions cover the core requirements while keeping the list concise and actionable for project management purposes.
