Sure, here is a minimal list of actions a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design must take to ensure compliance with the HTTPS-Only Standard while focusing on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI):

1. **User Interface Indications**: Ensure visual indicators (such as padlock icons) are present to show secure connections in the UI.
2. **Error Messages**: Design clear and user-friendly error messages for failed HTTPS connections to help users understand when and why a secure connection is not established.
3. **Security Awareness**: Provide in-app prompts or educational tooltips to inform users about the importance of HTTPS for their data security.
4. **Content Updating**: Coordinate with developers to make sure all embedded and external resources (images, scripts, fonts) are updated to HTTPS to avoid mixed content warnings.
5. **Visual Consistency**: Review and update any wording, graphics, and design aspects that may reference HTTP to align with the HTTPS-only requirement.
6. **Testing and Validation**: Conduct usability testing to confirm that security updates do not hinder the user experience or interface design.
7. **Redirect UX**: Design user-friendly redirects from HTTP to HTTPS to maintain a seamless user experience.
8. **HSTS Awareness**: Be aware of HSTS implications in design decisions to ensure users always connect over HTTPS and avoid unnecessary warnings or redirects in the user's flow.

By focusing on these aspects, the Designer can contribute to a secure and user-friendly web application that complies with the HTTPS-Only Standard.
