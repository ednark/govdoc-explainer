Here's a summary of the primary standards, guidelines, and requirements from the HTTPS-Only Standard document, with a focus on security, accessibility, user experience, and compliance:

Security:
1. All publicly accessible Federal websites and web services must use HTTPS.
2. HTTPS verifies website identity and encrypts information between the site and user.
3. Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for all HTTPS websites.

Accessibility:
1. All existing Federal websites must be accessible via HTTPS by December 31, 2016.
2. New Federal websites must comply with HTTPS policy upon launch.

User Experience:
1. HTTPS provides privacy and integrity protection for public web connections.
2. All browsing activity should be considered private and sensitive.

Compliance:
1. Agencies must prioritize HTTPS deployment using risk-based analysis.
2. High-priority sites include those with PII, sensitive content, or high traffic.
3. A public dashboard at pulse.cio.gov monitors agency compliance.
4. Intranet HTTPS use is encouraged but not required.

Key Points:
1. HTTPS is mandatory for all public Federal websites.
2. Implementation deadline: December 31, 2016.
3. Prioritize based on risk and sensitivity of information.
4. Use HSTS for added security.
5. Compliance is monitored publicly.
