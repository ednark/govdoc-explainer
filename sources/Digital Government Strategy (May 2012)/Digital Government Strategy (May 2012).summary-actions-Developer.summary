As a Drupal developer tasked with implementing backend business logic for a web application in accordance to the government standards from the Digital Government document, here is a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance:

1. **Embrace Open Data and APIs:**
   - Ensure all new digital services or modifications to existing services expose data through web APIs.
   - Make API endpoints available and well-documented at `agency.gov/developer` to comply with the government's open data policies.

2. **Adopt a Shared Platform Approach:**
   - Use common Drupal modules and distributions that follow open standards and allow for interoperability.
   - Contribute to and leverage shared repositories and codebases to prevent duplicative efforts and to enhance resource sharing.

3. **Ensure Information is Device-Agnostic:**
   - Design the backend to provide data in a way that is suitable for consumption on any device, ensuring APIs and services are accessible from various client-side platforms (desktop, mobile, etc.).

4. **Implement Information-Centric Architecture:**
   - Structure data and content to be accessible via APIs. Prioritize the separation of content management from its presentation, allowing data to be utilized by multiple platforms without redundancy.
   - Ensure content created in Drupal is done using structured formats that are easily consumable through APIs.

5. **Security and Privacy by Design:**
   - Embed security and privacy controls directly into the design of your data architecture and APIs. All data shared via APIs should be secured applying appropriate access controls.
   - Use Drupal best practices for user authentication and data encryption to safeguard sensitive information.

6. **Utilize Modern Tools and Technologies:**
   - Keep Drupal and its modules up to date to utilize latest security patches and features.
   - Use modern, supported versions of web technologies (e.g., JSON for APIs, HTML5, and CSS3 for frontend) to ensure compatibility and security.

7. **Performance, Scalability, and Accessibility:**
   - Implement caching and performance optimization best practices in Drupal to ensure the application can handle a high number of API requests efficiently.
   - Ensure all digital services comply with accessibility standards (like the Section 508 amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973).

8. **Continual Monitoring and Improvement:**
   - Use logging and monitoring tools to track the usage and performance of APIs and adapt services based on analytics gathered.
   - Regularly update documentation and developer portals to reflect changes and deprecated endpoints.

By following these guidelines in your web application projects, you will align with the governmentâ€™s standards for digital services, focusing on open data, interoperability, device-agnostic delivery, and robust security and privacy practices.
