Certainly! For compliance with the government standards as outlined in the Digital Government Strategy, you should consider the following actions as a checklist when developing a web application:

1. **Implement Open Data, Content, and Web APIs**:
   - Structure data and content so that it is open and machine-readable by default.
   - Provide data through web APIs wherever feasible allowing for wider access and integration.

2. **Adopt Device-Agnosticity**:
   - Ensure the application is accessible and functional across different devices and platforms (e.g., smartphones, tablets, desktops).

3. **Ensure Information Security**:
   - Integrate robust security measures from the beginning of the application development cycle.
   - Implement mechanisms for safe data exchange and storage, focusing on securing the data rather than just the device.

4. **Focus on Customer-Centric Design**:
   - Design the UI/UX with user engagement in mind, ensuring it is intuitive and accessible.
   - Incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve the user experience based on actual usage data.

5. **Enable Interoperability and Openness**:
   - Use standard, open formats and interfaces to ensure the application can easily interact with other tools and services.

6. **Leverage Shared Platforms and Services**:
   - Use government-provided platforms and infrastructure where possible to avoid duplication, reduce costs, and ensure consistency across government services.

7. **Practice Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation**:
   - Incorporate tools to measure performance and user satisfaction continuously.
   - Use the insights gained for ongoing improvements and compliance checks.

8. **Deploy Privacy and Security Controls**:
   - Design the application to incorporate privacy controls and security measures that protect users' data.
   - Ensure compliance with federal privacy laws and guidelines.

9. **Maintain Accessibility Standards**:
   - Adhere to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and other relevant standards to ensure accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities.

10. **Update Documentation and Compliance Details**:
    - Maintain detailed records of compliance steps undertaken.
    - Regularly review and update documentation to reflect new standards, guidelines, or changes in compliance requirements.

Following this checklist will greatly help in aligning with the government's operational and regulatory standards for digital services.
