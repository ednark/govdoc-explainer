To ensure compliance with the government digital standards as a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design, focusing on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) for web application projects, follow these key actions:

1. **Adopt an Information-Centric Approach**: Start by ensuring that the content is structured in a machine-readable format, such as web APIs, allowing flexibility and accessibility of the data irrespective of the presentation layer. This includes using valid metadata and separating content creation from its presentation to enhance usability and interoperability.

2. **Implement a Customer-Centric Design**: Prioritize the needs and preferences of the users by researching and understanding their behavior and requirements. Design intuitive navigation and accessible interfaces that adapt to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring information is easily findable and transaction processes are streamlined.

3. **Ensure Device-Agnostic Presentation**: The application should function seamlessly across all types of devices. Utilize responsive design or adaptive design techniques to ensure consistency in user experience whether accessed via desktop, tablet, or mobile.

4. **Embed Security and Privacy by Design**: Integrate comprehensive security and privacy controls directly into the design and development processes. This includes securing the data at the API level and using metadata for security enforcement, thereby focusing on securing the data rather than just the device.

5. **Utilize Shared and Open Platforms Where Applicable**: Leverage existing government-configured platforms and shared digital services to reduce duplication and cost. Engage in open-source communities where applicable to use and contribute to shared solutions which can help accelerate development and foster innovation.

6. **Enhance Accessibility**: Comply with all relevant accessibility standards to ensure the application can be used by people with disabilities. This includes adhering to the guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and ensuring all interactive and multimedia features are accessible.

7. **Optimize for Performance and Quality**: Implement performance metrics and conduct continuous testing to ensure high functionality and smooth user interfaces. Opt for mobile first design principles where appropriate to enhance mobile user experience.

8. **Continuous User Feedback Incorporation**: Establish mechanisms for collecting ongoing user feedback and make iterative improvements to the digital services based on this input. This aligns with creating a participatory user environment, reinforcing user engagement and satisfaction.

9. **Government Compliance and Standards Adherence**: Regularly update and ensure adherence to all specified federal, state, and local digital standards and regulations for compliance, including data protection and privacy laws relevant to the service and user location.

10. **Document and Analyze Usage Data**: Implement analytics to monitor how users interact with the application. Use these insights to further refine and optimize the user experience and interface, ensuring they meet the strategic goals of customer-centric and information-centric principles.

Addressing these actions will substantially align your web application designs with government standards while ensuring a strong focus on user experience and interface.
