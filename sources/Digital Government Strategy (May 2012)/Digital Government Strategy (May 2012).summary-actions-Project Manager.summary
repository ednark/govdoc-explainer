1. **Adopt Information-Centric Approach**: Architect systems for open data using web APIs from the onset, ensuring data is accessible, interoperable, and uses standard, open formats across different platforms and systems.

2. **Implement a Shared Platform Strategy**: Leverage existing platforms and infrastructures for the development and launch of web applications, and ensure the new applications are built with reusable and shareable components across government agencies.

3. **Maintain a Customer-Centric Focus**: Design and structure the web application to meet the needs of the user efficiently and reliably across various devices and platforms. Prioritize accessibility and usability in all design and deployment phases.

4. **Ensure Privacy and Security**: Integrate robust security measures and privacy protections throughout the application development lifecycle. Follow best practices for data protection, authentication, and compliance with federal privacy regulations.

5. **Data and Content Openness by Default**: Ensure that new content and data are exposed through well-documented and accessible APIs and tagged with metadata for easy consumption and reuse. Adopt a public-oriented stance on data access unless restricted by policy.

6. **Use Performance Metrics and Customer Feedback**: Implement tools to gauge application performance and user satisfaction continuously. Use this data to optimize and refine the application iteratively.

7. **Streamline and Standardize APIs**: Follow government policies on web API development and standardization to facilitate easier access, integration, and management of government data sources.

8. **Engagement and Transparency**: Actively engage with stakeholders and the public to gather input, share progress, and iterate based on feedback for improving service delivery.

9. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the application is responsive and optimized for mobile devices to accommodate a wider range of user access scenarios.

10. **Compliance with Relevant Policies and Standards**: Ensure all aspects of the application adhere to mandated federal IT and web management policies, including cybersecurity standards and accessibility guidelines (e.g., Section 508). 

Following these streamlined actions will help align the web application project with the essential government standards for digital services.
