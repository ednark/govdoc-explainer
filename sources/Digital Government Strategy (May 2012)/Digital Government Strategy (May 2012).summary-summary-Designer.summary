**Summary of Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements Focused on UX/UI Design and Accessibility:**

1. **Information-Centric Approach**:
   - Emphasize utilizing open data and content, handling data and content as discrete, machine-readable entities that can be tagged, shared, and secured.
   - Build for interoperability from the start, ensuring data is easily accessible across devices and platforms.

2. **Customer-Centric Approach**:
   - Focus on understanding and adapting to the needs of the end-users.
   - Ensure content is accessible from any device, at any time, enhancing user experience by making interfaces simple, efficient, and useful.
   - Agencies must involve public feedback to continuously refine and improve user interactions.

3. **Security and Privacy in Design**:
   - Implement security and privacy features from the earliest stages of the design process.
   - Architect systems to be secure without depending on the security of the device by focusing on data security.
   - Adopt privacy-enhancing technologies and ensure transparency in how data is collected and used.

4. **Performance and Accessibility Standards**:
   - Follow modern web development standards to ensure high performance and accessibility, such as HTML5 and CSS3.
   - Maintain compliance with Section 508 for accessibility to ensure services are usable by all people, regardless of ability.
   - Use responsive web design to ensure content is accessible and functional across various devices.

5. **Shared Platform Approach**:
   - Leverage shared services and infrastructures to reduce costs and ensure consistency across digital touchpoints.
   - Encourage the use of shared and open content management systems that support accessibility and security features.
   - Promote code sharing and re-use to streamline development and maintain consistency.

6. **Open Data and Content with Web APIs**:
   - Make government data and content available through open APIs to promote innovation and transparency.
   - Ensure that new systems are designed for openness by default with high-value data accessible for public use.
   - Tag all structured data with valid metadata for easier access and integration.

**Even Shorter Summary:**

- **Information-Centric Approach**: Treat data as open, interoperable, and machine-readable for universal access.
- **Customer-Centric Approach**: Design with the end-user in mind, ensuring accessibility and user-friendly interfaces that are device-agnostic.
- **Security Measures**: Integrate security and privacy features from the start; focus on securing the data rather than the device.
- **Performance and Accessibility**: Adhere to modern standards like HTML5, CSS3, and Section 508 for responsive and accessible designs.
- **Shared Platforms and APIs**: Utilize shared digital services and open APIs to foster innovation, ensure consistency, and improve service delivery efficiently.
