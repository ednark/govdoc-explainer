For a web application project to show compliance with the government digital standards from the perspective of a DevOps technician, the following minimal list of actions should be taken:

1. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Ensure infrastructure uses secure, scalable cloud computing solutions.
2. **Web API Implementation**: Expose high-value data and content through secure and documented web APIs.
3. **Security and Privacy**: Implement robust security measures, including data encryption and continuous monitoring.
4. **Access Control**: Set up identity, authentication, and credential management systems.
5. **Open Standards**: Use open standards and technologies (e.g., HTML5, CSS3, IPv6).
6. **Interoperability**: Design systems for interoperability and openness.
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement performance and customer satisfaction analytics tools.
8. **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensure the web application is device-agnostic and works seamlessly on mobile devices.
9. **Data Protection**: Employ appropriate measures to secure Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive data.
10. **Backup and Recovery**: Establish and test disaster recovery and data backup procedures.
11. **Compliance Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for the security measures, API usage, and compliance actions taken.

These actions will demonstrate adherence to the essential requirements of the government digital standards in the infrastructure design and management of your web application.
