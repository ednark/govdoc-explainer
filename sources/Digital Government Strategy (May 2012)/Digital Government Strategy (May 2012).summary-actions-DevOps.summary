1. **Design for Interoperability and Openness**:
   - **Architecture Planning**: Ensure that web applications are architected from the outset to support data and service interoperability using open standards and APIs, to facilitate data sharing and integration.

2. **Secure and Privacy-Focused Infrastructure**:
   - **Security Integration**: Implement robust security controls throughout the development lifecycle, including data encryption, secure authentication, and regular security audits.
   - **Privacy Measures**: Build privacy into the application by design, ensuring all personal data handling complies with government regulations on privacy protection.

3. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - **Responsive Design**: Develop applications with a mobile-first approach, ensuring cross-device compatibility and functionality without the need to create separate versions for different devices.

4. **Utilize Open Data and APIs**:
   - **Open Data Consumption**: Leverage external government open datasets available via APIs for enhancing functionality.
   - **API Provision**: Expose high-value internal data via secure, well-documented APIs to promote external usage and integration.

5. **Implement Performance Metrics and Monitoring**:
   - **Performance Tracking**: Deploy analytics and monitoring tools to consistently measure the applicationâ€™s performance and user engagement.
   - **Feedback Integration**: Implement mechanisms to capture user feedback continually to inform service improvements.

6. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**:
   - **Automated Deployment**: Set up automated pipelines for testing, integration, and deployment of code changes, ensuring swift movement from development to production environments.
   - **Configuration Management**: Use configuration management tools to maintain control over infrastructure and software versions.

7. **Cloud Services Utilization**:
   - **Cloud Adoption**: Leverage cloud-based infrastructure for enhanced scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, ensuring compliance with government policies for cloud deployments.

8. **Documentation and Compliance**:
   - **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation on system architecture, APIs, data schemas, security measures, and compliance checks.
   - **Regulation Adherence**: Regularly review and align operations with the latest government IT policies and standards.

Each of these actions ensures that the infrastructure is not only compliant with the government standards but is robust, scalable, and secure. Additionally, maintaining flexibility to adopt emerging technologies and practices is vital for staying compliant and innovative.
