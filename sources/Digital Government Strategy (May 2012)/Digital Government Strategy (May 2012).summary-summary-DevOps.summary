### Document Summary: DevOps Perspective on Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

#### Primary Standards, Guidelines, and Requirements

1. **Open Data, Content, and Web APIs**:
   - New IT systems must be architected for openness and exposed high-value data and content as web APIs at a granular level with metadata tags.
   - Agencies should evaluate and publish data in a timely manner, ensuring it is accessible and usable, and post it in a machine-readable format.

2. **Shared Platform**:
   - Encourages the use of shared infrastructures, services, and applications to reduce costs and duplication through shared services and common standards.
   - Supports participation in open-source communities and public crowdsourcing.

3. **Customer-Centric Approach**:
   - Services should be designed to meet the needs of customers, providing data and services anytime, anywhere, and on any device.
   - Emphasize the accessibility and usability of digital content, maintaining standards for readability and current information.

4. **Security and Privacy**:
   - Implement security and privacy by design in all phases of digital service delivery, focusing on encrypting sensitive data and ensuring data is shared securely.
   - Support continuous monitoring and robust identity and credential management.

5. **Asset Management and Procurement**:
   - Agencies must shift to an enterprise-wide asset management and procurement model to leverage government-wide contracts for better pricing and standardization.

6. **Performance and Customer Satisfaction**:
   - Use analytics and customer satisfaction measuring tools on all websites to drive improvements in digital service delivery based on performance data.

#### Focus Sections

1. **Security**:
   - Architect systems for security from inception, focusing on data protection over device security.
   Rating the security at data level with encryption and controlled access is emphasized over physical device security.

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure digital services are accessible to all, including those with disabilities, adhering to standards like Section 508 for accessibility.

3. **User Experience**:
   - Website and mobile applications must be designed to ensure an optimal user experience, working efficiently across different devices and platforms.
   - Emphasis on user-centered design and testing to meet the needs of various user demographics.

4. **Compliance**:
   - Adherence to federal IT standards and guidelines for secure and efficient deployment of IT systems.
   - Compliance includes using federated data structures, open APIs, and following open data initiatives.

#### Condensed Summary

- Architect and deploy IT systems with a focus on open data access through web APIs, ensuring systems designed are interoperable and meet federal standards for data security, privacy, and accessibility.
- Utilize shared services and platforms to reduce cost and avoid duplication. Emphasize a customer-centric approach by creating responsive, accessible, and user-friendly digital services.
- Manage IT assets and procurement at an enterprise level to leverage collective buying power and streamline asset management. Employ robust security measures focusing on data over devices and use analytics to continually improve services based on user feedback and performance metrics. Compliance with federal and industry standards is mandatory, focusing on securing data and interoperability.
