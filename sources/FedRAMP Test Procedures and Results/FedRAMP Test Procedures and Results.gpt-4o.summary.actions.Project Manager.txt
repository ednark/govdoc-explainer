Here's a minimal list of actions that a project manager must track and organize to ensure compliance with government standards for a web application:

1. **Identify System Information:**
   - Document the formal name of the cloud service offering.
   - Record the system acronym.
   - Capture the cloud service provider's (CSP) name.
   - Record the 3PAO's (Third Party Assessment Organization) name.

2. **Determine Categorization Level:**
   - Identify and document the categorization level (Li-SaaS, Low, Moderate, or High).

3. **Assess Controls Implementation:**
   - Track the number of controls that need to be tested.
   - Organize the testing of controls to determine which are satisfied vs. other than satisfied.
   - Document controls that are not applicable.

4. **Identify and Document Risks:**
   - Record controls marked as 'Other than Satisfied' and their associated risk levels (High, Moderate, Low).
   - Ensure all identified risks are documented with appropriate details.

5. **Summarize Control Results:**
   - Auto-generate and review the summary boxes for controls and associated risk levels.

6. **Document Family Control Procedures:**
   - Ensure each control family (e.g., AC, AU, AT) and associated control details are documented.
   - Record test methods used (Examine, Interview, Test).
   - Document observations, test results, and evidence collected.

7. **Evaluate Assessment Results:**
   - Use dropdowns to document assessment results (Satisfied, Other than Satisfied).
   - Identify and document any associated risks.
   - Assign likelihood and impact levels for risks and auto-calculate risk exposure levels.

8. **Recommend Risk Mitigations:**
   - Document proposed recommendations to remediate risks and align with control requirements.

9. **Check for SSP Differentials:**
   - Identify and document any SSP implementation differentials.
   - Aggregate differentials into a PL-2 risk for remediation.

10. **Review and Finalize Documentation:**
    - Ensure all tabs (System, Control Summary, Family Tabs) are completed and reviewed.
    - Validate auto-generated summaries for accuracy.
    - Finalize all documented findings and recommendations.

By following these steps, a project manager can track and organize work to guide a project towards compliance with the required government standards.
