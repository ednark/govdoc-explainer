To ensure a web application developed with Drupal is compliant with the relevant portions of the government standards document, a developer should focus on the following minimal list of actions:

1. **Identify & Document System Information:**
   - Ensure the **System Name**, **System Acronym**, **CSP (Cloud Service Provider) Name**, and **3PAO (Third-Party Assessment Organization) Name** are properly recorded in the System Tab.

2. **Security Controls Implementation:**
   - Implement all necessary **NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5** security controls.
   - Follow the **FedRAMP Moderate baseline** controls for documentation.

3. **Assessment Procedure:**
   - Conduct internal testing against the specified procedures using **Examine, Interview, and/or Test** methods.
   - Document the **observations/test results** and **evidence** of compliance for each control.

4. **Assessment Results:**
   - Utilize the assessment result dropdowns to mark each control as **Satisfied** or **Other than Satisfied**.
   - Ensure to document any associated risks identified with controls marked as **Other than Satisfied**.
   - Indicate the **likelihood** and **impact levels** of the identified risks.

5. **Mitigation Recommendations:**
   - Provide clear and concise recommendations to remediate any identified risks to align with control requirements.
   
6. **Configuration Management:**
   - Follow secure configuration management practices for code and infrastructure.
   - Ensure all changes are tracked and version-controlled.

7. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Implement logging to track and monitor access and activities within the system.
   - Ensure proper monitoring mechanisms are in place to detect and respond to incidents.

8. **Access Controls:**
   - Use strong access control mechanisms to restrict data and system access to authorized personnel only.
   - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) within Drupal.

9. **Encryption:**
   - Ensure encryption is used for data at rest and in transit.
   - Verify that all encryption methods meet the specified standards in the FedRAMP requirements.

10. **Regular Updates & Patching:**
    - Regularly update and patch the Drupal core and contrib modules to address vulnerabilities.

By focusing on these key actions, the developer can help ensure that the web application adheres to the necessary compliance standards specified in the government standards document.
