For a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design, focusing on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) for web applications, the following minimal list of actions should be taken to ensure compliance with government standards, particularly those relevant to FedRAMP:

1. **User Authentication Mechanisms**:
   - Implement secure login flows with multi-factor authentication (MFA).

2. **Access Control Features**:
   - Design interfaces to manage user roles and permissions effectively.

3. **Data Encryption Indicators**:
   - Clearly indicate when data is being encrypted both during transmission (e.g., HTTPS) and at rest.

4. **Security Awareness and Training**:
   - Ensure that the UI informs users about key security features and best practices (e.g., password strength indicators).

5. **Audit Logs Accessibility**:
   - Provide accessible UIs for authorized users to view audit logs and system activity.

6. **Error Messaging**:
   - Design clear and secure error messages that do not disclose sensitive information.

7. **Privacy Notices**:
   - Include clear privacy notices and consent mechanisms in the UI.

8. **Sensitive Data Handling**:
   - Perform Data Minimization principles (e.g., only collect necessary user information) visibly in the design.

9. **User Session Management**:
   - Implement automatic session timeouts and visible session expiration warnings.

10. **Accessibility Compliance**:
   - Follow Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.

By focusing on these actionable items, you can ensure that the web application's UX/UI is aligned with relevant government security standards and contributes to the overall compliance of the project.
