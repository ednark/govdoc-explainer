Certainly! Here are the minimal actions for a project manager of a web application to ensure compliance:

1. **Data Protection Measures**:
   - Ensure SBU/PII data is encrypted and properly stored.
   - Implement access controls for sensitive data.

2. **Incident Reporting Procedures**:
   - Define and implement clear processes for reporting security incidents.
   - Ensure timely reporting of any potential or actual security breaches.

3. **User Access Management**:
   - Verify and document roles and access levels for users.
   - Regularly review and update user access permissions.

4. **Secure Communication Protocols**:
   - Enforce secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, encrypted emails).
   - Avoid transmission of sensitive data through unsecure mediums.

5. **Employee and Contractor Training**:
   - Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees and contractors.
   - Ensure understanding of handling sensitive information and reporting incidents.

6. **Technical Safeguards**:
   - Implement and maintain firewalls and anti-malware tools.
   - Regularly update and patch software systems.

7. **Security Reviews and Audits**:
   - Schedule regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
   - Document findings and remedial actions taken.

8. **Configuration Management**:
   - Manage and document changes to system configurations.
   - Ensure all changes are approved by a Configuration Change Board (CCB).

9. **Password Policies**:
   - Enforce strong password protocols (complexity and periodic changes).
   - Ensure storage of passwords complies with security standards.

10. **Contingency and Incident Response Plans**:
    - Develop and document a contingency plan for data breaches or system failures.
    - Test and update the plan regularly.

Tracking and fulfilling these actions will assist a project manager in ensuring the project remains compliant with relevant government security standards.
