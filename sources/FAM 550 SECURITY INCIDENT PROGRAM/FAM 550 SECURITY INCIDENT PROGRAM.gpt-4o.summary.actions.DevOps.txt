Sure, here's a minimal list of actions a DevOps technician should take to ensure compliance with the relevant government standards outlined in the document:

1. **Access Control**:
   - Implement and enforce multi-factor authentication.
   - Manage and monitor user accounts to ensure proper authorization levels.

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.
   - Regularly update and patch systems to protect against vulnerabilities.

3. **Incident Management**:
   - Configure systems to generate and capture logs for audit and incident response.
   - Implement mechanisms to detect, report, and respond to security incidents.

4. **Network Security**:
   - Secure network architecture with firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
   - Isolate sensitive components of the application through network segmentation.

5. **System Hardening**:
   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - Disable unnecessary services and remove unused software to reduce attack surfaces.

6. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Regularly back up critical data and verify the integrity of those backups.
   - Develop and test a disaster recovery plan to ensure quick recovery in case of an incident.

7. **Configuration Management**:
   - Utilize automated configuration management tools to enforce security baselines.
   - Maintain an inventory of systems and software, ensuring all configurations comply with approved settings.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement continuous monitoring tools to track system performance and security events.
   - Retain log files according to policy requirements, ensuring availability for audits and investigations.

These actions should help ensure the technical infrastructure supporting the web application is secure and compliant with government standards.
