Hereâ€™s a minimal actionable list tailored for a Drupal developer implementing backend business logic for a web application to ensure compliance with the specified government standards:

1. **Secure Login Implementation**
   - Ensure all user logins are encrypted (TLS/SSL).
   - Enforce strong password policies and complexity requirements.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Implement access permissions based on user roles, limiting access to classified and sensitive information.
   - Regularly review and update user roles and permissions.

3. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
   - Use secure storage (e.g., database encryption) for classified and sensitive information.

4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Implement input validation to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure all user inputs are sanitized before processing.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement logging for security-related events (e.g., failed login attempts, changes in user roles).
   - Ensure logs are protected and monitored for suspicious activities.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
   - Log detailed error information securely while showing generic error messages to users.

7. **Session Management**
   - Implement secure session management practices, including timeout and session invalidation on logout.
   - Use session cookies with secure and HttpOnly flags.

8. **Regular Security Updates**
   - Apply security patches and updates for Drupal core and contributed modules regularly.
   - Monitor Drupal security advisories and update dependencies promptly.

9. **Data Access and Sharing**
   - Restrict direct access to sensitive data and enforce data sharing policies.
   - Log and monitor all access to classified and sensitive information.

10. **Backup and Recovery**
    - Implement secure and encrypted data backup solutions.
    - Regularly test data recovery processes to ensure data integrity and accessibility.

11. **Compliance Documentation**
    - Maintain documentation detailing compliance measures and configurations.
    - Update accordingly with any changes to the security practices or application architecture.

12. **Third-Party Integrations**
    - Review and ensure third-party modules and APIs comply with security standards.
    - Limit and control third-party access to sensitive data according to policies.

These steps directly align with ensuring the application maintains high security standards as required by the document, focusing on practical measures a Drupal developer can implement in their development process.
