Sure, focusing on the perspective of a Designer specializing in Human Centered Design and UX/UI, here are the minimal actions you must take:

1. **Identify User Roles and Permissions:**
   Ensure interfaces facilitate proper user role assignments to control access to various parts of the system.

2. **Design Secure Login and Authentication:**
   Implement secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

3. **Data Privacy Notices and Consent:**
   Include clear and accessible privacy notices to inform users about the handling of their personal data and obtain their consent where necessary.

4. **Error Handling and Alerts:**
   Design error messages that are helpful but do not reveal sensitive information that could be exploited.

5. **Access Logs and Audit Trails:**
   Ensure the user interface captures necessary actions for security logging (e.g., logins, data access) in accordance with compliance requirements.

6. **Secure Data Display and Storage:**
   Ensure sensitive data is securely displayed (e.g., masking sensitive information) and does not store sensitive information on the client-side.

7. **Design for Secure default settings:**
   Ensure that the default settings of the application follow secure practices (e.g., automatic logout, secure password requirements).

8. **User Friendly Security Features:**
   Integrate security features that are easy to use and understand, such as secure password reset processes, without diminishing security.

9. **Conducting Usability Testing:**
    Plan and execute usability testing sessions to ensure that security features are not hindering productivity and are user-friendly.

10. **Accessibility:**
    Ensure the application follows accessibility standards so all users, including those with disabilities, can securely use the application.

By addressing these key areas, a designer can ensure that the user experience and interface design adhere to necessary security standards and regulations.
