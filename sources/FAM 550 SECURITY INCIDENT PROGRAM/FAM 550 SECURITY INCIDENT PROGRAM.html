<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-398;   02-24-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. This subsection contains examples of security
incidents, in accordance with <a
href="https://usdos.sharepoint.com/sites/a-gis/dir/fam/Pages/12fam/12fam.aspx">12
FAM 600</a>, that affect the protection of classified information with respect
to information systems.  The examples are illustrative and indicate the wide
range of possible security incidents in this area.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Examples of classified security incidents involving
information systems include, but are not limited to: </p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Failure to remove and properly secure media, such

<p class=FAMHeading16><a name="M552_3">12 FAM 552.3 </a> Special Category of
Security Violations</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-378;   02-24-2022)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The Department&#8217;s communications security
(COMSEC) incident program, including its reporting procedures, is in <a
href="/fam/05fah06/05fah060530.html#H530">5 FAH-6 H-530</a>.  </p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. The Program Applications Division (DS/IS/APD)
evaluates all COMSEC incident reports and renders an adjudication based on
evidence of the degree of national security information compromised.  DS/IS/APD
provides a copy of the notification letter to the Cryptographic Services
Branch.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  Although the COMSEC program's administrative
aspects (e.g., timely accounting of inventories) are important, failure to
perform such aspects will not be investigated as a security violation or
infraction under the security incident program when there is no evidence of a
direct effect on the system's security.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading18><a name=M553>12 FAM 553 </a> Unclassified Security
Incidents</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-378;   02-24-2022)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Unclassified security incidents under this chapter
relate to misuse of unclassified Department systems or mishandling of
Sensitive/SBU or otherwise administratively controlled information.  Incidents
involving the mishandling of classified information or misuse of classified
Department systems are addressed under <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0550.html#M554">12
FAM 554</a>, Reporting of Security Incidents.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. An unclassified security incident occurs when there
has been a contravention of any published Department policy, procedure or
acceptable use guidelines and that contravention represents a failure to
safeguard Department information or information systems, resulting in actual or
elevated risk of damage to Department information systems, or actual or
elevated risk of compromise or loss of control of administratively controlled
Department information.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  An unclassified security incident may be
adjudicated as a violation or an infraction based on the risk and magnitude of
the harm to Department information or information systems or the risk of harm
to affected individuals.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading18><a name=M554>12 FAM 554 </a> Reporting Security Incidents</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-398;   02-24-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Reporting potential security incidents is the
responsibility of every individual with access to information within the
Department or a Department information system.  When Department personnel or
other U.S. Government personnel under COM authority become aware of an improper
security practice that may result in a security incident, they must report
their concern to the DS/IS/APD, either via the regional security officer (RSO)
(if abroad) or via the bureau security officer (BSO) (if domestic).  Timely
reporting is imperative so that remedial action may be taken.  Reporting to
DS/IS/APD ensures that all potential security incidents can be properly
investigated and adjudicated.  This does not supersede any other reporting
obligations, such as requirements for certain incidents involving Department
systems to be reported to the information systems security officer (ISSO) in
accordance with <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0620.html#M623_8">12 FAM 623.8</a> and
<a href="/fam/12fah10/12fah100240.html#H242_5">12 FAH-10 H-242.5</a>.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Security incidents may also be detected and reported
in the following manner:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  During the normal course of their duties, ISSOs
will report anomalies and other suspicious activities to the Cyber Incident
Response Team (DS/CIRT).  DS/IS/APD coordinates daily with the DS/CIRT,
collecting and analyzing their data to determine which events should be
investigated as potential security incidents.  When potential security
incidents are identified, DS/IS/APD will contact the appropriate RSO or BSO and
advise them to initiate a security investigation;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  When the RSO or BSO identifies a possible security
incident, they must immediately notify DS/IS/APD and, when appropriate, the
ISSO, to initiate a security incident investigation; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  When the ISSO identifies a possible security incident
they must immediately notify the RSO or BSO, as appropriate, and the Bureau of
Information Resources Management Directorate of Cyber Operations and the CIRT. 
Regional computer security officers may also report potential security
incidents to the ISSO and/or RSO, as appropriate.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  Incidents that are required by Federal mandate to
be reported to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center
are reported in accordance with <a href="/fam/12fah10/12fah100240.html#H240">12
FAH-10 H-240</a>.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading16><a name="M554_1">12 FAM 554.1 </a> Reporting Security
Incidents Involving Non Department Employees and Contractors </p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-378;   02-24-2022)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Report security incidents involving employees of
other Federal agencies or organizations and/or their contractors in the same
manner as described in <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0550.html#M554">12 FAM 554</a>
paragraph a and b.  The RSOs abroad report such security incidents on Forms
OF-117 and OF-118 and send the forms to DS/IS/APD.  DS/IS/APD coordinates any
further investigation necessary to complete the report of findings.  DS/IS/APD
must forward this report to the parent agency of the employee allegedly
responsible for the incident, and the parent agency handles the adjudication
and disposition.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Report security incidents involving Department
contractors in the same manner as described in <a
href="/fam/12fam/12fam0550.html#M554">12 FAM 554</a> (a) and (b), except
DS/IS/APD forwards Forms OF-117 and OF-118 to the employer and sends a copy of
each form to the DS Office of Information Security&#8217;s Industrial Security
Division (DS/IS/IND).</p>

<p class=FAMHeading16><a name="M554_2">12 FAM 554.2 </a> Security Inspections</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-378;   02-24-2022)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Cleared U.S. citizen security personnel designated
by the Program Applications Division (DS/IS/APD), RSOs, Marine security guards,
and/or U.S. citizen contract guards are responsible for conducting security
inspections to ensure that classified information is properly protected.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. Cleared security personnel must conduct such
security inspections routinely for all offices, buildings, or other facilities
that come under the jurisdiction of the Department worldwide, except those
exempted under interagency agreements.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  During regular business hours, employees have
authority to lock desks and credenzas to secure personal items.  After regular
business hours, employees must not lock desks, bookcases, and credenzas unless
the inspecting security office has a master key that affords access to perform
security inspections.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading16><a name=M555>12 FAM 555 </a> Investigating and Processing
Security Incidents</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-398;   02-24-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. The RSO (abroad) or BSO (domestically), or DS/IS/APD
if no BSO has been assigned by APD, herein referred to as &#8220;the investigator,&#8221;
will investigate potential security incidents.  The investigator may require
technical assistance from the ISSO, system manager, the Directorate for Cyber
and Technology Security (DS/CTS) or others.  The investigation will attempt to
determine:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  If a potential criminal act or instance of serious
employee misconduct has occurred (in which case the matter will immediately be
referred to the relevant DS Office);</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  The validity of the incident (does it meet the
definition of an unclassified security incident or classified security incident
as defined in <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0010.html#M013">12 FAM 013</a>);</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  The gravity of the incident;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(4)  Mitigating and aggravating factors; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(5)  Identity of individual(s) suspected of the
incident (&quot;suspected individual&quot;).</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. In investigations where an investigator seeks to
interview an employee who is a member of a collective bargaining unit for which
a union representative has exclusive representation rights, and the employee
reasonably believes that the interview may result in disciplinary action
against him/her, the employee may request that such representative be included
in the interview and the investigating official shall comply.  This right is
known as the Weingarten Right.  When the employee invokes the Weingarten Right,
the investigating official will allow a reasonable amount of time for a union
representative to attend the interview.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  When the investigator has collected sufficient
information to conclude the investigation:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  The investigator will prepare a Form OF-118,
Record of Incident, completing Part 1A or 1B (as applicable) in its entirety; </p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  The investigator will present the Form OF-118 to
the suspected individual for execution of their portion of Part 2 &#8211; <span
class=Underline>Statement of Person Suspected of Incident</span> and their signature. 
At that time, the investigator will discuss the contents of the form and
potential ramifications.  Form OF-118 allows the suspected individual to
provide any mitigating factors, such as lack of culpability, which they believe
would be pertinent to the adjudication process;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  The suspected individual shall return the signed
Form OF-118 to the investigator as soon as possible, but not later than three
working days.  If the suspected individual fails or refuses to sign the form
within three working days, the investigator will document this fact in the
security officer comments on Form OF-118 Part 3 - <span class=Underline>Comments
of Unit/Post/Regional Security Officer</span>; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(4)  The investigator will then give the Form OF-118 to
the suspected individual&#8217;s immediate supervisor for review and signature
within three working days.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. After the supervisor has signed and returned the
form:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  The investigator will complete Part 3; reporting
the results of the investigation in a brief summary, indicating whether the
suspected individual should be a held accountable for this incident; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  The investigator will submit their investigative
findings, any additional supporting documentation, and the Form OF-118 to
DS/IS/APD for adjudication. </p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. At a constituent post, the post security officer
(PSO) may perform these duties on behalf of the RSO and forward all
investigative documentation and the Form OF-118 to the responsible RSO.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  The investigator must provide a copy of the
completed Form OF-118 to the individual(s) suspected of the incident.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading18><a name=M556>12 FAM 556 </a> Evaluation of Security
Incidents</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-419;   09-28-2023)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Once the investigator has concluded the
investigation, they will provide the completed OF-118 and all related
information to DS/IS/APD for adjudication.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. DS/IS/APD evaluates and adjudicates all reported
security incidents to determine:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Whether the reported incident is valid;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  Whether the reported incident constitutes an
infraction or violation;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  Whether the reported incident requires additional
documentation or coordinating action; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(4)  Whether the individual suspected of the incident
is culpable.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>c.  Adjudication has three possible outcomes: valid,
unfounded, and valid but not culpable.  DS/IS/APD performs the final
adjudication of all security incident investigations, including administrative
(i.e., non-criminal) investigations that the Office of Inspector General
conducts and investigations conducted by other DS investigative entities
involving the possible or actual failure to protect classified national
security information.  This requirement is not meant to include cases presented
to the Department of Justice<span class=FAMNewRevisedText> </span>for criminal
prosecution.  After DS/IS/APD's affirmative adjudication that an employee
committed a valid security <span class=Bold>incident</span>, DS/IS/APD
initiates any <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0550.html#M558">12 FAM 558</a><span
class=FAMNewRevisedText> </span>administrative action when required.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>d. A basic premise for adjudication is to hold
individuals responsible for their actions.  However, in certain incidents,
DS/IS/APD's adjudication may include having supervisors and/or system owners
held responsible for failing to provide effective organizational security
procedures.  This might occur, for example, when abnormal conditions interrupt
routine security procedures and supervisors  and/or system owners do not
implement remedial controls, or when the incident relates to controls that are
not normally the sole responsibility of an individual.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>e. When the security incident investigation does not
warrant implicating a specific individual, DS/IS/APD may still adjudicate the
incident as valid without holding a specific individual accountable, provided
that:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  Mitigating circumstances generally prevent
narrowing responsibility to an individual; and</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  The DS/IS/APD chief approves this type of
adjudication.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>f.  Upon completion of the adjudication, DS/IS/APD will
notify in writing the culpable individual(s) of the adjudication results
specific to them, as well as appeal options.  DS/IS/APD will also notify the
appropriate RSO, BSO, or principal unit security officer (PUSO), who will
provide a copy of the adjudication to the individual&#8217;s supervisor.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>g. Incidents involving potential criminal activity such
as the deliberate introduction of risk or damage to Department information
systems or networks or any other criminal act, or deliberate or negligent
contraventions of the Privacy Act of 1974, will be immediately forwarded to the
Office of Special Investigation (DS/DO/OSI) for consideration and may be
subject to criminal prosecution.</p>

<p class=FAMHeading18><a name=M557>12 FAM 557 </a> Appeals</p>

<p class=FAMCTLineFlush>(CT:DS-378;   02-24-2022)</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. An individual found culpable in a valid security
incident may appeal either the validity of the incident or their culpability in
the incident by submitting the appeal to the division chief, DS/IS/APD.  This
appeal request must be submitted in writing within 10 working days after
receiving written notification of the DS/IS/APD adjudication decision.  An
individual may request an extension of time in which to submit an appeal, but
that extension request must be submitted within the 10-working day timeframe. </p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc><span class=Bold>    NOTE:</span> The statement
provided on form OF-118 is considered pre-adjudicative and considered part of
the investigation.  It does not constitute an appeal even if it states an
intent to appeal.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>b. DS/IS/APD will forward for decision any appeal along
with the complete investigative record to the director of the Office of
Information Security (DS/SI/IS).  The director of DS/SI/IS will provide a final
decision and no further appeals are available.</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTextabc>a. Upon adjudication of a valid security infraction(s),
and affirmation of that adjudication following any appeal, DS/IS/APD will take
the following actions:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(1)  If the infraction is the employee&#8217;s first
incident (which includes both infractions and violations; see <a
href="/fam/12fam/12fam0550.html#M552">12 FAM 552</a> paragraph c and <a
href="/fam/12fam/12fam0550.html#M553">12 FAM 553</a>. paragraph c) in the
current five-year moving window (see <a href="/fam/12fam/12fam0010.html#M013">12
FAM 013</a> for definition), DS/IS/APD will send a letter of notification to
the employee, requiring a signed reply acknowledging that the employee
understands the policies contravened in the incident and the potential
consequences of future security incidents, including referral to the Bureau of
Global Talent Management (GTM) for appropriate disciplinary action, and the DS
Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/SI/PSS) for action relating to
the employee&#8217;s security clearance.  The RSO or PSO abroad, or BSO, PUSO,
or unit security officer (USO) domestically, must ensure the employee receives
appropriate remedial security instruction;</p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(2)  If the infraction is the employee&#8217;s second
incident (infraction or violation) in the current five-year window, the Office
of Information Security (DS/SI/IS) will send a letter to the employee that
describes the actions DS and GTM will take in the event of future security
incidents.  This requires a signed reply from the employee indicating they
understand the respective policies and consequences of future security
incidents.  The RSO or PSO abroad, or BSO or USO domestically, must provide the
employee with an additional appropriate security briefing; </p>

<p class=FAMBodyText123>(3)  If the infraction is the employee&#8217;s third
(or more) incident (infraction or violation) in the current five-year window,
DS/IS/APD will refer the complete security incident history of a Department
Foreign Service (FS) or Civil Service (CS) employee to:</p>

<p class=FAMBodyTexta>(a)  The GTM Office of Employee Relations (GTM/ER) for
appropriate disciplinary action in accordance with <a
