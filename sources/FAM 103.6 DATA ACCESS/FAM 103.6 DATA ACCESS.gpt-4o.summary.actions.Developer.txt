Certainly! For a developer implementing a web application in Drupal, here are the minimal actions required to ensure compliance with the listed government standards:

1. **Read-Only Data Access to CDO**:
   - Ensure data and metadata can be read-only accessed by the Chief Data Officer via an Enterprise Data Inventory or Catalog setup.
   - Implement Drupal roles and permissions to facilitate this.

2. **Disaggregated Demographic Data Handling**:
   - Follow DEIA Data Dissemination and Usage Policy (20 FAM 301.2) when handling demographic data.
   - Consult DEIA Data Working Group (DEIAData@state.gov) for masking guidance.

3. **Unrestricted Data Access Documentation**:
   - Document and state clearly which users have unrestricted access to data.
   - Define and configure roles and attributes for data access in the Drupal backend for all data sets.

These steps should help in meeting the specified government standards related to data access in the web applications you develop.
