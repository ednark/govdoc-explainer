### Minimal Actions for a Designer to Ensure Compliance with Government Standards for Data Access

1. **User Roles Identification:**
   - Define and clearly label user roles for access control within the web application.

2. **Permissions Documentation:**
   - Ensure the UI has clear indications of who has unrestricted access to data.

3. **Data Catalog Integration:**
   - Include a section in the UI for the Enterprise Data Inventory/Catalog accessible by the Chief Data Officer in a read-only format.

4. **DEIA Compliance Notice:**
   - Display information about DEIA data handling policies prominently in sections dealing with disaggregated demographic data.

5. **Contact Information:**
   - Provide easy access to the DEIA Data Working Group contact information (DEIAData@state.gov) within relevant sections for user inquiries about masking and data policies.

6. **Metadata Display:**
   - Ensure metadata is accessible and clearly associated with relevant datasets within the user interface.

7. **Access and Restrictions Transparency:**
   - Develop a user-friendly way to clearly state data access restrictions and roles within the UI.

By incorporating these actions into the design and user interface of the web application, the Designer can help ensure the project adheres to the specified government standards for data access.
