As a DevOps technician, here's a minimal list of actions to ensure compliance with the applicable government standards on data access:

1. **Provide Read-Only Access**:
   - Set up read-only access to data and metadata for the Chief Data Officer via the Enterprise Data Inventory and/or Catalog.

2. **Comply with DEIA Policies**:
   - When handling disaggregated demographic data, implement policies and procedures in line with the Department’s DEIA Data Dissemination and Usage Policy.
   - Contact DEIA Data Working Group (DEIAData@state.gov) for guidance on data masking if needed.

3. **Define and Manage Access Control**:
   - Clearly specify and document who has unrestricted access to data.
   - Define roles and access attributes for different users and ensure the infrastructure enforces these access controls consistently.

These actions should help align the web application’s infrastructure management with the relevant portions of the government standards.
