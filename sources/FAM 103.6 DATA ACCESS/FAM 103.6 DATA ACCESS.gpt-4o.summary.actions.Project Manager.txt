To ensure compliance with the Government Standards Document in our web application projects, the Project Manager must track and organize the following actions:

1. **Setup Access for Chief Data Officer:**
   - Ensure read-only access to relevant data and metadata is provided to the Chief Data Officer via the Enterprise Data Inventory and/or Catalog.

2. **Disaggregated Demographic Data Handling:**
   - Implement policies and procedures for disaggregated demographic data as per the DEIA Data Dissemination and Usage Policy (20 FAM 301.2).
   - Consult with the DEIA Data Working Group (DEIAData@state.gov) for specific masking questions.

3. **Define Data Access Roles:**
   - Clearly document and communicate who has unrestricted access to data.
   - Define user roles and establish attributes for granting access to specific data sets.

Key checkpoints for each action may include relevant system configuration adjustments and internal policy documentation, ensuring they align with the above standards.
